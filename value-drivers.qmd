# Strategic policy objectives

**Strategic Objectives** or *priority outcomes* refer to overarching priority aims of policy making such as maintaining resource security, tackling climate change and increasing economic prosperity (HM Treasury, 2022). These are often stated in government plans and strategies and frame more detailed commitments.

## {{< fa money-bill-transfer >}} Maximising the value of resources and increasing economic prosperity

While the X wealthiest country in the world measured in GDP per capita, in a context of rising prices, living standards (proxied by per capita real household disposable income) in the UK are projected to fall by up to 10% in the 2023-24 financial year (OBR, 2022).

Against this backdropm, anticipated economic opportunities for the UK from a more circular economy reflect on one hand the potential costs avoided by moving away from more linear configurations, and on the other, against-baseline economic benefits of more circular setups. Several studies have pointed to the potential economic benefits from the more efficient, circular and sustainable treatment of materials, including to firms, through cost reductions including from no/low-cost investments (Oakdene Hollins, 2007; 2009; 2017; Wrap, 2016; Eunomia, 2017), increases in total factor productivity (Baptist and Hepburn, 2013) and reductions in exposure to price fluctuations and associated risk premiums for capital (Chatham House, 2012; Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler 2016); to households, through increased disposable income (Pearce, 2001); and the government, through cost-reductions such as assocated with solid waste management which made up the largest proportion of all UK government environmental protection expenditure in 2019 (£11.6 billion) (ONS, 2021).[^1]

For example, the CEC for Mineral-based Construction Materials as part of the NICER programme has identified opportunities for the UK economy including: up-skilling the UK workforce; the development of new material, product and system design, manufacturing and logistics businesses; and business savings through increased material efficiency.

[^1]: While investment costs, opportunity costs and uncertain payoffs (Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler 2016) need to be accounted for, several macroeconomic analyses of circular economy transitions have also pointed to positive impacts on macroeconomic outcomes such as GDP and total employment (McCarthy, Dellink and Bibas, 2018; EMF, 2015; Cambridge Econometrics, 2021), though highlighting re-allocation effects across sectors.

## {{< fa temperature-three-quarters >}} Tackling climate change and maintaining natural capital

Respondents to the 2020 OECD Survey on the Circular Economy in Cities and Regions identified climate change as the number one driver of interest in the circular economy at the city and region-level (OECD, 2020). At a national level and in the UK specifically, concern for the impacts of climate change can be traced back to at least the 1980s under the Thatcher government (Lorenzoni and Benson, 2014).

To meet the target of reducing UK carbon emissions by 80% 1990-2050 set by the 2008 Climate Change Act and subsequently amended in 2019 to commit the UK to 'net zero', a significant overhaul of the UK energy system has been a clear objective from the outset. The improved treatment of material resources (as key intermediaries of environmental pressures such as greenhouse gas emissions) has also received growing interest across government departments as a key route by which to deliver against carbon budgets. Most recently, the UK Climate Change Committee's recommendations for achieving the 6th Carbon Budget featured resource efficiency measures as a means by which to reduce UK territorial emissions. These measures included design optimisation, increased recycling and reuse and heightened product longevity, utilisation and sharing.

## {{< fa shield-halved >}} Bolstering resource security

Trade grew as a proportion of global GDP from the 1980s enabled by technological innovations such as containerisation. This has led to increasing interconnectedness and interdependency between people and places across supply chains in goods and services and labour, capital, technology and information. Whilst 'geoeconomic concern' featured as only the 10th most significant perceived risk over the next decade by respondents to the 2022 annual World Economic Forum Global Risks Perception Survey (WEF, 2022), there is evidence of a shift away from China-centric globalisation and closer international economic integration since at least the 2008 financial crisis, as further accelerated by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

Resource security have been a concern for the UK government for some time, reflected in the 2012 Resource Security Action Plan led by Defra and BIS focussing on metals and minerals perceived to be of particular strategic importance but with uncertain supply, as well as subsequent research updates. Most recently, the 2022 Critical Minerals Strategy and 2023 [Critical Minerals Refresh](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-critical-mineral-strategy/critical-minerals-refresh-delivering-resilience-in-a-changing-global-environment-published-13-march-2023) has highlighted supply chain risks to, for instance, rare earth elements of importance to technologies for meeting 'net zero' objectives. The strategy put forward accelerating to a more circular UK economy as a means by which to lessen import dependency and security of supply risks to meeting societal objectives.

### Strategic portfolios

A '**Strategic Portfolio'** is said to consist of related government programmes and projects whose aim it is to implement and enable the real world changes or outcomes that together can help realise strategic objectives (HMT, 2022). *Portfolios for government interventions on CE considered in terms of circular economy value drivers outlined below will sit across UK countries, central government departments and central and local government actors.*

Defined by its specific contribution to the objectives of the strategic portfolio of which it is part, a **Programme** refers to a coordinated series of Sub-Programmes and Projects focussed on the delivery of strategic objectives e.g. the NICER programme encompassing multiple centres. A **Project** refers to a temporary organisation designed to produce a specific predefined output in a more discrete time period and using predetermined resources (HMT, 2022).

In some cases, the grounds for introducing policy can also thought about in terms of responding to particular 'failures' which act as barriers to achieving these societal objectives.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Tackling 'market failures'

A market failure is a problem that violates one of the assumptions of the first theorem of welfare economics (that a private market economy will achieve efficiency) and causes the market economy to deliver an outcome that does not maximize efficiency. Markets operate efficiently when achieving allocative/pareto efficiency (i.e. all net welfare-enhancing improvements in the allocation of goods or services have been exhausted).

The conditions required to maximize market efficiency include, among others, perfect information as well as the absence of externalities and split incentives ([Van Ewijk, 2018](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=1&ProjectID=20074)). At the level of the economy as a whole, 'market failures' that inhibit a increase in resource efficiency, resource productivity and a more circular economy include ([Van Ewijk, 2018](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=1&ProjectID=20074)):

1.  **Externalities** - As well as eating into natural capital stocks when use rates exceed those of renewal, processes of extraction, production and disposal can often also negatively impact the environment via pollution and land use change. These impacts are frequntly unmarketed, with externalities referring to uncompensated costs or benefits. Correcting these frequently requires the involvement of government to reduce the oversupply of negative externalities or enhance the undersupply of positive externalities;

2.  **Missing markets or excessive market frictions -** Linked often to the issue of externalities, an absence of markets can lead to missing economic incentives for activities that can reduce externalities such as using secondary materials. Regulations encouraging these markets to develop sch as secondary material requirements, or reduced market frictions through providing data platforms for industrial symbiosis e.g. N. Ireland's resource matchmaking scheme are examples;

3.  **Split incentives** - Split incentives refer to instances where an actor in the position of being able to make a decision which might improve the treatment of resources does not stand to gain even though others may ([Ekins et al. 2019](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/Ekins-2019-Circular-Economy-What-Why-How-Where.pdf)), thereby leading to limit incentives to make changes ([Defra, 2013](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265022/pb14091-waste-prevention-20131211.pdf)). Examples of this are manufacturers not being incentivised to design products for more circular end of life treatment as they do not shoulder the costs of waste disposal nor stand to gain from recovered resources under most management regimes. Policy levers which can help correct this include market-ordering instruments such as extended producer responsibility (Bleischwitz, 2008).

4.  **Information failures -** A wide range of data-gaps exist relevant to the circular economy and in particular, information asymmetries can exist between producers and consumers regarding product characteristics such as for durability or ease of repair. These can be viewed as a failure in information markets. Information-based instruments, including programmes of guidance and disclosure requirements can be used to tackle these.

Information-based instruments, including developing relevant data systems, programmes of guidance to SMEs and introducing information-disclosure requirements, work to resolve information undersupply and asymmetries. Price and market-based instruments work by reflecting externalised environmental costs within market prices or by creating property rights over the environment and facilitating exchange of these. Market-ordering instruments such as extended producer responsibility (EPR) work by aligning the incentives of actors to ensure they are responsible for and benefit from, environmentally-relevant decisions.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Tackling 'system failures'

The UK is one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world. This has been supported by conducive physical and technological infrastructure, scientific and technological capabilities and high levels of human capital, strong education and training, the availability of risk capital and wider social contextual factors (Camagni, 1996; Storper, 1997; Gertler, 2004). An 'innovation-systems' perspective emphasises the role of regulation in tackling factors inhibiting innovation[^2] ([van Ewijk, 2018](http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=1&ProjectID=20074)). These partly overlap with market failures (e.g., positive knowledge externalities), but also include an absence of relevant infrastructure and institutions ([Maskell, 2000](https://research.cbs.dk/en/publications/social-capital-innovation-and-competitiveness)), low levels of human capital and limited access to required resource.

Government can support innovation processes via laws and regulation. This includes through strategically deploying technology-push (Stimulating the supply of new technologies), demand-pull (increasing the size of a market for new technologies) and environmental policies (to support technologies the emergence or expansion of which may be undermined by market failures) ([Sandén and Azar, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2004.01.012)) while ensuring targeted support at all stages of the innovation process. This ranges from supporting niches via sufficient funding for education and research and strengthening intellectual property protection regimes, to market formation and diffusion via public procurement requirements and price floors. Destabilizing the sought-to-be-replaced regime through control policies, changes in regime rules and reductions in support for dominant technologies such as phasing out subsidies are equally critical ([Kivimaa and Kern, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2015.09.008)).

Government, and too other actors, can also support innovation through enabling interactions via the development of stakeholder discussion platforms to support constructive collaboration and competition. The use of waste as resources, for example, depends on mutual trust between entrepreneurs. They can also build capabilities through the provision of education, funds and collaborative platforms to build knowledge and skills.
:::

[^2]: Innovation can be defined as change leading to new dimensions of performance. It involves the transformation of inventions into usable innovations through processes of learning and practice ([Drucker, 2014](https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315747453)), that emerge most organically as new combinations of technologies and ways of doing things become more economically viable or accepted than those of old (Schumpeter, 1934). This process acts to 'incessantly revolutionise the economic structure from within (Schumpeter, 1942). Innovation can happen at the level of products through the introduction of a new product or quality of product, through the introduction of new methods or processes, the opening of new markets, result from new sources of supply through input innovation and also occur across social and institutional domains ([Jordan, Lemke and Liedtke, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1002/eet.1632)).Multiple shifts in technology can be seen in the long-term historic record of humanity and which have impacted the scale and composition of resources used and waste generated. In the Neolithic period, biomass was the primary material group relied upon, including for the purposes of heating, clothing, shelter and utensils. Some 12,000 years later, the materials of modern civilisation include ammonia, steel and concrete, alongside a massive proliferation of new chemicals for which the environment frequently has limited or no assimilative capacity.

::: {.callout-important collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Tackling 'transition failures'

While addressing market failures is thought about as a key objective public interest regulation, even well functioning markets in terms of being allocatively efficient can be blind to long-term societal goals (van Ewijk, 2018). To promote sustainable consumption, production and investment, some degree of institutional planning initiated by a community or government can also be necessary (van Ewijk, 2018; Weber and Rohracher, 2012). In many cases furthermore, major societal breakthroughs have been achieved not solely by resolving market failures, but through concerted government effort to drive long-term change, including dedicated research funding and infrastructural development (Mazzucato, 2015). The government plays an important role in driving the direction of long-term societal change and interrupting, where desirable from the perspective of societal goals, prevailing technological equilibria benefitting from scale, learning and network effects.

Therefore, transitioning to more resource productive systems of production and consumption can be undermined by 'transition failures' such as insufficient guidance and coordination for driving a system towards intended outcomes. Policy instruments to resolve transition failures include target setting which can offer strategic direction to engender focussed action. Globally, attention is increasingly turning towards the importance of targets related to resource use (WEF, 2020). While in the UK to date, there has been a focus on targets to drive waste away from the lowest rungs of the waste hierarchy e.g., landfill diversion targets and recycling target, a target to reduce the per capita treatment of residual waste will be introduced in England through the Environment Bill while other goals which have been introduced include that to lower Wales' 'global footprint'.

Another set of policy intervention relates to coordination of sectors to ensure coherence in actions. More resource efficient technologies may be cheaper and more effective if widely adopted, but achieving widespread adoption requires breaking out of existing technological equilibrium. As no individual actor has sufficiently strong incentive or capacity to change this, governments may wish to coordinate across actors to achieve shared long-term benefits. Coordination and ensuring policy coherence across sectors and time can be done through aligning policies across sectors, and materials such as between requirements for recycled content and the sufficient provision of waste infrastructure to collect recyclables.
:::

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple"}
## Amending 'government failures'

Government or regulatory failure can occur where state actors have failed to intervene where it could have otherwise realistically promoted greater efficiency. This can be understood as regulatory failure of the first type. On the other hand, government intervention having led to a less efficient situation than before or what might have otherwise realistically been due e.g. to poor policy design, costs of interventions being higher than benefits or missing information can be thought of as failure of the second type. The types of issues arising through regulatory failure can span all other failures outlined here. For instance, predominant models of consumer responsibility in the UK are based on 'collective responsibility', with the costs for the collection and recycling shared among participating companies based on the amount of products put on the market. This approach results lowers the ambition of individual companies to develop more circular products as a company would have to bear the costs of improved design and production changes while the benefits of the reduced end-of-life costs would be shared with all other companies in the market i.e. there is a split incentive as a result ([Van Rossem et al. 2006)](http://www.foeeurope.org/extended-producer-responsibility-report)

# Circular economy as a framework to deliver societal objectives

Developing a more circular economy has been proposed as a strategy by which (the environmental impacts of) our natural resource consumption and waste generation can be significantly reduced in a context of growing environmental degradation, while delivering economic and resource security benefits. But what do we mean by a circular economy?

A lot of contemporary interest in the idea of a circular economy (CE) has been driven by the work of the [Ellen Macarthur Foundation](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-economy-introduction/overview), who define a CE in terms of the following guiding principles and alongside a shift towards renewable energy and materials:

1.  **Eliminate waste and pollution** - the absolute decoupling of resource consumption, waste production and pollution from economic activity to bring these into line with more sustainable levels;

2.  **Circulate products and materials (at their highest value)** -- maximising the value created from resources used in the economy; and

3.  **Regenerate nature -** by moving towards a more circular economy, supporting natural processes and leaving more room for nature to thrive.

The [European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/economy/20151201STO05603/circular-economy-definition-importance-and-benefits) (2022) further detail the types of activities that can contribute to these principles, with the CE a: "model of production and consumption which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible". Also underpinning many definitions of the CE is a step-change from earlier waste management paradigms, with a 'systems thinking' approach to designing out waste from the outset ([Hill, 2016](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20571-7_13)).

# CE measures and value-drivers

## Measures

Realising a more circular UK economy will require and involve changes in production and consumption practices across the economy, including at the level of products and production processes, wider infrastructure and business and consumption models. On the production side, these include substituting (often imported) material inputs for labour and capital via, for instance, greater domestic remanufacturing as well as primary for secondary materials, where used. On the consumption side, they include moving towards service-based consumption and keeping products in use for their technical lifespan (OECD, 2022).[^3]

[^3]: A range of approaches have been proposed in the literature relating to the UK-specifically and more widely. A 2009 study by WRAP and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) examined the potential of 14 resource efficiency strategies applied in the UK, 7 of which focused on the production-side and 6 of which, consumption, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Production strategies included: lean production (e.g. lightweighting and reduced production process losses); material substitution; reduction of waste and increased recycling; dematerialization of the service sector; sustainable building; and the efficient use of existing infrastructure. Consumption strategies included: lifetime optimization (using goods for their technical lifetime); goods to services (e.g. renting instead of buying products); reducing food waste; dietary change; the expansion of a more restorative economy (e.g. reuse and refurbishment) and public sector procurement. In an update to this study, Norman et al. (2021) outlined eight resource efficiency and resource sufficiency strategies with the potential to reduce UK territorial and overseas emissions associated with material consumption. These strategies include: 1) reducing food waste, as well as the overconsumption of food and carbon intensity of diets; 2) moving from goods to services for certain products; 3) making better use of existing products through lifetime extension; 4) lightweighting products; 5) increasing recycled content; and 6) substituting high-carbon materials for those low-carbon. Hertwick et al. (2019) in a study of material efficiency strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings, vehicles, and electronics, identified a range of broad resource efficiency measures including: 1) increasing the intensiveness of product use i.e. using less material to provide the same service e.g. via increased space-efficient design of buildings or increasing product utilisation rates; 2) lifetime extension (including through repair, resale and remanufacture); 3) lightweight design; 4) reuse of components including through remanufacturing and modularity; 5) recycling, upcycling and cascading; 6) improved production yields and substitution of primary for secondary raw materials as well as substitution across material types. A 2021 United Nations Environment Programme report examined the potential of: 1) material substitution; 2) light-weighting; 3) Increasing intensity of use; 4) lifetime extension; and 5) reuse and recycling, in residential buildings and light weight vehicles for reducing emissions. The Climate Change Committee in an assessment of the role of resource efficiency in achieving the 6th carbon budget, categorised resource efficiency measures into the following groups: design optimisation to reduce material inputs (3 MtCO2e per year in 2035), increased recycling and reuse (3 MtCO2e, of which half is through reuse of construction materials), increasing product longevity (2 MtCO2e, largely from electronics), and increased product utilisation and sharing (1 MtCO2e, including sharing leisure equipment and car clubs).

These changes can be referred to as *measures*, which will carry private and public costs and benefits and be associated with risks and opportunities. In addition, the choice of policy instrument(s) applied in an attempt to bring these changes about, are already and will also continue to have, an important role in defining the cost and benefits of these pathways. The five centres making up the NICER programme covering resource flows including textiles, construction minerals, steel, chemicals and technology metals, have identified a range of measures across value chain stages needed to unlock the benefits of a more circular economy in the UK.

For the [Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Centre for Mineral-based Construction Materials (ICEC-MCM)](https://ce-hub.org/centre-for-mineral-based-construction-materials/), these include:

-   Altered product design, including the rationalisation of materials and improved disassembly;
-   Greater capacity in production processes for using secondary materials e.g. electric-arc furnaces for steel;
-   Changes in purchasing decisions towards products that are more durable;
-   Increased repair and reuse;
-   Greater certification of used goods; and
-   More consistent waste collection.

For the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Circular Metals (CircularMetal](https://ce-hub.org/centre-for-circular-metals/)), these include:

-   EAF steel production to be more affordable;
-   The use of more generic aluminium and steel alloys;
-   Purchases based on durability and life-cycle costs;
-   Changes in ownership models to enable refurbishment and reuse;
-   Improved valuation of used parts;
-   New melt processing techniques; and
-   New scrap sorting and recycling technologies.

For the [Textiles Circularity Centre (TCC)](https://ce-hub.org/textiles-circularity-centre/), these include:

-   Additive manufacturing for the fabrication and finishing of textiles; and
-   Chemical recycling.

For the [National Interdisciplinary Centre for the Circular Chemical Economy (CircularChem)](https://ce-hub.org/centre-for-circular-chemical-economy/),  these include:

-   Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to olefins

## Value drivers

These measures can be grouped into several broad *strategies* or *value drivers* ([Hirsch and Schempp, 2020](https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/sites/default/files/categorisation_system_for_the_ce.pdf)) which in line with a systems-based approach, need to be applied in combination to achieve large scale CE transformation:

## {{< fa tape >}} Circular design and production strategies

Focus on altering existing products or the development of new products to support circular and resource efficient usage. This can be through: design and production and process technologies enabling circular economy strategies further down the value chain; the development and sustainable production of new materials (including bio-based) that are reusable, recyclable or compostable; substantial reductions in substances of concern; the substitution of virgin materials with secondary raw materials and by-products; and reduced material intake through yield loss reduction (including possible substitution) at the process level and lightweighting[^4] or doing away with unnecessary inputs altogether.[^5]
:::

::: {.callout-tip .g-col-4 collapse="true" style="column-gap: 0.1;" icon="false"}
## {{< fa circle-right >}} Circular and optimal use models

Aim to increase the value and use of a product during its (extended) lifetime, including through use intensification. These business and consumption models revolve around enhanced durability: realising technical lifespans; reuse, repair, refurbishment, repurposing and remanufacturing products, their components and assets otherwise discarded; product-to-service, reuse and sharing models based on, inter alia, leasing, pay-per-use, subscription or deposit return schemes; and rehabilitation of degraded land to return to useful state and remediation of abandoned or underutilized brownfield sites in preparation for redevelopment.
:::

::: {.callout-important .g-col-4 collapse="true" style="column-gap: 0.1;" icon="false"}
## {{< fa recycle >}} Circular value recovery models

Focus on intercepting legacy resource flows and maximising the recovery and recycling of materials from these after use into new products or useful resources in order to reduce waste. This includes through the development of new reverse logistics to return the products from the point of consumption to the point of production is of huge importance in the category; separate collection and reverse logistics of wastes as well as redundant products, parts and materials enabling circular value retention and recovery strategies; recovery and valorisation of materials from waste (including biomass) and recycling of wastewater.
:::
:::

[^4]: Reduce the amount of materials (primary and secondary) consumed along a manufacturing activity.

[^5]: A 2022 OECD review of UK CE policy recommend: "Continue development of a UK product design strategy that supports circular economy goals. This could draw on current work in the European Union and other OECD economies for product standards on durability, reuse, repair and recyclability, together with co-ordination with other advanced economies, including via OECD working parties."

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" icon="false"}
## {{< fa chart-pie >}} Circular support models

Circular support models that focus on the management and coordination of networks, resources such as tools, applications and which incentivise circularity and other supporting activities. They can also support the provision of enabling technologies that facilitate circular business models.

Aligned and extending the strategies for CE value creation, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation outline strategic-level *policy goals* 'to develop, deploy and scale circular economy solutions' ([EMF, 2021](https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/universal-policy-goals/overview)) which include:

1.  Make the economics work;
2.  Invest in innovation, infrastructure and skills e.g. investing in domestic reprocessing capacity ([Green Finance Strategy, BEIS, 2023](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1147377/mobilising-green-investment-2023-green-finance-strategy.pdf)); and
3.  Collaborate for systems change.
:::

Instruments making up the policy toolkit can be used to achieve short-to-medium policy objectives aligned to these value drivers, which, in turn, can help achieve overarching goals. For example, mandatory resource efficiency standards might be used to remove the worst performing products from the market or drive improvements in input efficiency, labels can be used to enable improved consumer purchasing decisions and bans or taxes might be used to discourage most problematic end-of-life treatment options. Furthermore, instruments can differ in their effectiveness and efficiency in achieving these medium and long-term policy objectives.

## Linking policy to value drivers

-   Examples of policies at the production/product design stage include ecodesign requirements around design (for e.g. durability, repairability, recyclability) or embodied carbon content standards.

-   Policies at the consumption phase include purchasing requirements for public procurement related to resource efficiency criteria and labelling.

-   End of life instruments include targets on reuse and recycling, EPR, investment in recycling and bans or restrictions on certain waste treatments (Milios, 2021).
