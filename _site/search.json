    "text": "Given its potential, as interest in the concept of a CE has grown, so too have the number of questions about its potential advantages, consequences, costs and ‘how to’. This has led to a great deal of research papers each adding to an increasing number of definitions, classifications and visual representations of the CE. This is understandable given that the scope of CE implementation can be categorized at many different scales—encompassing activity, process, value chain stages, whole value chain or multi-tier systems. These can also operate at many different levels, whether individual actors, sectors, the local, regional or global.\nThe way that goods and services are produced, used and disposed of within the global and UK economy is often complex, involving multiple actors spanning institutional and industrial sectors and activities across different countries. The term ‘value chain’ refers to the full range of activities needed to create a product or service. This includes across the ‘linear’ stages of extraction, production, processing, manufacture, distribution, retail, use and disposal as well as those typically associated with a ‘circular’ economy – such as recycling, repair and remanufacturing – where being undertaken. Other actors are involved in functions ranging from monitoring and regulating to investment, the administration of imports and exports and transactions more widely.\nTo facilitate a shared understanding of CE among and between stakeholders, there is a need for an agreed taxonomy or classification of terms and entities relevant to the field of interest, including what constitutes eligibility criteria for activities to be labelled circular. This is an important first step to be able to concisely describe the current state of play in relation to a desired CE target state and chart the transformation steps required to get there.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps in a CE value chain assessment\nA taxonomy is a hierarchical classification system used in enterprises, organizations, and administrations to categorize various entities, encompassing both physical and conceptual elements (Smith, 2005; Hodgson, 2019). These may include processes, products, knowledge domains, human groups, and actors, all adjustable to different levels of granularity. Taxonomies can serve as a consistent and comparable framework, providing the basis for data collection, integration and in-depth description of a current value chain and its inputs. A hierarchical structure plays a crucial role in facilitating additional analyses related to the CE, such as quantifying value added at each step of the value chain, assessing externalities (via processes such as life cycle assessment and quantifying social impact), delineating collaboration and responsibilities and identifying opportunities for CE value creation.\nA key benefit of a taxonomic approach to CE is to provide a powerful approach to map retrieve unstructured and structured data (Lysaght et al. 2022) and allow for efficient, transparent and navigable visualisation in the management of resource and waste flows. This is particularly beneficial in the context of complex organizational models for value chains, workflows, knowledge resources or relationships across relevant entities. An effective CE taxonomy is one that meets the interests, challenges, needs and questions raised by different stakeholder groups—that is, one that stands up to scrutiny. A taxonomy must therefore be able to support the segmentation, comparability and measurement of CE interventions, including product life extension, material substitution, changes in a policy against key performance indicators and metrics, for example national resource consumption to a product carbon footprint.\nThe CE-Hub value chain taxonomy\nSignificantly, the creation of our agnostic taxonomy is also the foundation for the NICER CE data observatory which quantifies the stocks and flows of strategic materials, components and products through the UK economy and the size of the benefits and target state for future CE transformations (columns 1 and 3 in Figure 7). This paper adds to these, by classifying many of the policy interventions (column 2) and relevant actors and stakeholders who need to be engaged and incentivised across the value chain to bring about CE transformation.\nBuilding a robust baseline data model is a first step in spotting economic opportunity, and an evidence-based approach to explore and quantify prospective CE policy interventions. Questions around the CE are often approached as one-off data requests or studies, which both individually and cumulatively, can be expensive, time consuming, and restricted to single use, the very opposite of a circular economy. Having a systems view of data collection and value-analysis, requires a different approach, one we term ‘circular data’ (Nolan et al. 2022; Nolan, 2023). The CE-Hub value chain taxonomy and data modelling framework (Figure 9) has been designed to address different stakeholder questions (diagnostic/synthesis layer) about biophysical materials flows and impacts, economic, social and environmental costs and benefits at a variety of scales. Adding a business dynamics capability supports CE value creation exploration at a range of scales, cross value chain and with high customization potential aligned back to stakeholder questions and KPIs, including the choice and mix of policy instruments and actors, discussed in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nA circular economy data modelling framework\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nA range of approaches have been proposed in the literature relating to the UK-specifically and more widely. A 2009 study by WRAP and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) examined the potential of 14 resource efficiency strategies applied in the UK, 7 of which focused on the production-side and 6 of which, consumption, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Production strategies included: lean production (e.g. lightweighting and reduced production process losses); material substitution; reduction of waste and increased recycling; dematerialization of the service sector; sustainable building; and the efficient use of existing infrastructure. Consumption strategies included: lifetime optimization (using goods for their technical lifetime); goods to services (e.g. renting instead of buying products); reducing food waste; dietary change; the expansion of a more restorative economy (e.g. reuse and refurbishment) and public sector procurement. In an update to this study, Norman et al. (2021) outlined eight resource efficiency and resource sufficiency strategies with the potential to reduce UK territorial and overseas emissions associated with material consumption. These strategies include: 1) reducing food waste, as well as the overconsumption of food and carbon intensity of diets; 2) moving from goods to services for certain products; 3) making better use of existing products through lifetime extension; 4) lightweighting products; 5) increasing recycled content; and 6) substituting high-carbon materials for those low-carbon. Hertwick et al. (2019) in a study of material efficiency strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings, vehicles, and electronics, identified a range of broad resource efficiency measures including: 1) increasing the intensiveness of product use i.e. using less material to provide the same service e.g. via increased space-efficient design of buildings or increasing product utilisation rates; 2) lifetime extension (including through repair, resale and remanufacture); 3) lightweight design; 4) reuse of components including through remanufacturing and modularity; 5) recycling, upcycling and cascading; 6) improved production yields and substitution of primary for secondary raw materials as well as substitution across material types. A 2021 United Nations Environment Programme report examined the potential of: 1) material substitution; 2) light-weighting; 3) Increasing intensity of use; 4) lifetime extension; and 5) reuse and recycling, in residential buildings and light weight vehicles for reducing emissions. The Climate Change Committee in an assessment of the role of resource efficiency in achieving the 6th carbon budget, categorised resource efficiency measures into the following groups: design optimisation to reduce material inputs (3 MtCO2e per year in 2035), increased recycling and reuse (3 MtCO2e, of which half is through reuse of construction materials), increasing product longevity (2 MtCO2e, largely from electronics), and increased product utilisation and sharing (1 MtCO2e, including sharing leisure equipment and car clubs).↩︎"

    "text": "Moving towards a more circular economy in the UK presents new data needs, challenges and opportunities. These exist from micro-level interactions in purchasing and capital allocation decisions to the macro-level as an input into opportunity scanning and setting direction with central government policies. Across these needs, high quality, reliable, relevant and timely data are frequently sought. Being in the centre of information and knowledge networks as well as having the ability to regulate hierarchically means central and local government actors can have a key role in filling many data gaps (Hood, 1983; Duit, 2019).\nInformation-based policy instruments seek to create boundary conditions to smoothe socio-technical transitions by influencing knowledge, resolving information-market failures and equipping quasi-regulators (Circle Economy, ). Information-based approaches are diverse covering different directions of flows between actors and include: mandating information disclosure with this information then presented on labels or in registers in any attempt to resolve information asymmetries between actors; the provision of guidance to resolve information gaps; and the regulation of environmental ‘claims’ such as made in advertising regarding the performance of products and organisations.\nOverall, information-based instruments are an important part of a circular-economy policy framework, though their effects alone are likely to be small."

    "text": "Effectiveness and efficiency\n\nEffectiveness\nInformational strategies have long been central to attempts to promote pro-environmental behaviour, however while some studies have found environmental knowledge plays a role in pro-environmental behaviours (e.g. Bartkus et al. 1999), others have found environmental knowledge to have no effect (e.g. Pedersen and Neegaard 2006). Knowledge-action and value-action gaps have been identified in the literature and describe disparities between individual’s knowledge for the environment and their behaviour, which can importantly be influenced by economics (e.g. prices of green options being too high) in addition to other psychological and sociological factors.\nInformation-based approaches can also take time to have an impact (NAO, 2014) and it can be difficult to anticipate how people will react to new information.\nThe effectiveness of informational approaches depend on the quality and type of information reported, its relevance to the intended audience and the resulting capacity to change business behaviour (Sunstein, 1999).\nThe potential impact of information-based instruments will depend on the type of information and its salience, while it will be parameterized by how embedded that information becomes in the decision-making processes of users and disclosers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 Eurobarometer survey covering EU energy label, confirmed that 93% of the population recognised the energy labels, and that 79% of Europeans had been influenced by the label when purchasing an appliance.\nGenerally good evidence they have driven change in the EU’s energy efficiency of labelled products when used in unison with standards.\nSQW Consultancy (2007) concluded eco-labelling and minimum energy performance standards have been effective in increasing energy efficiency in household appliances in the EU, but that labelling alone would not have been effective.\nEuropean Commission (2018) – Evidence from literature reviews, stakeholder intervals, focus groups and experiments showed improved information at the point of purchase was effective at promoting circular economy behaviours. Nudges informing consumers of benefits and norms of buying durable/reparable products increased salience of CE characteristics and triggered shifts in preferences towards more durable/reparable products. When durability or reparability info was provided in experiments, consumers were almost 3 times more likely to choose products with the highest durability on offer, and more than two times more likely to choose products with the highest reparability ratings. Depending on how durability/reparability information was presented, willingness-to-pay for an additional year of durability ranged between 20-36 euros for vacuum cleaners and dishwashers, 92-148 for TVs and 148-217 for smartphones. Improved reparability ratings were around 29-54 euros for vacuum cleaners, 83-105 for dishwashers, 77-171 for TVs and 48-98 for smartphones.\nA 2016 study commissioned by the European Economic and Social Committee used a stated choice experiment in a simulated online retail platform to assess the influence of lifespan labelling on consumer purchasing choices for 9 product categories in four regions under different price scenarios. All types of labels examined were found to affect stated purchase decisions, and on average, sales of long-lived products increased by 14% relative to shorter lived products in the same class. All product groups with exception to televisions were affected, varying from sales of longer-lived products increasing by 24% for suitcases to 11% for smartphones, influenced by the expected replacement rate of these different products. The anomaly for televisions was explained by limited variation across the products proposed.\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee (2016) - An experimental study on the influence of Lifespan Labelling on Consumers with a sample of 2,917 participants across four different European regions (France, Spain, Czech Republic, and Benelux)  and using a dummy retail website to test the effects of lifespan labelling across nine product categories (including suitcases, printers, coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, smartphones, televisions and wash machines) and 10 variations of each, found lifespan labelling had an influence on purchasing decisions in favour of products with longer lifespans. On average, sales of products with a label showing a longer lifespan than competing products increased by 13.8%. Though a significant influence was evident for eight of nine product categories tested, this effect was not uniform across the products purchased, with simulated purchase of televisions not significantly affected by environmental labelling. Suitcases and printers were the products for which labelling had the greatest effect, while smartphones and televisions saw the weakest impact (+11.4%). 90% of respondents were happy to pay more for a similar product with a lifespan that was 2 years longer. On average were willing pay to 102 Euros for this assurance for a dishwasher priced between EUR 300 and EUR 500. Out of four labels tested: 1) a label showing useful lifespans in terms of cycles, page yield; 2) a label showing lifespan in years or months; 3) a label showing cost per year; and 4) a label similar to the energy label, with a scale from A to G. The labels appearing to be particularly effective were 4 (+20.4%) and 2 (+14.1%). Issues with the study are that samples haven’t been based on quotas, and the experimental approach involved limiting the variable to durability labels, while holding constant all else. Thus hasn’t allowed for trading off with other attributes outside of price.\nErskine and Collins (1997) - Little evidence had been seen in the effectiveness of European Commission eco-labels for paper products put in place in 1992.\nGaspar and Antunes (2011) – Research across several EU nations found energy efficiency was the fourth most important attribute after cost, quality and the price-quality tradeoff. Thus, while eco-labels provide desired information, such information is still less important than more traditional product attributes.\nKerret and Gray (2007) - Difficult to measure effectiveness of PRTRs in the Anglo-countries for Industry chemicals absolutely, but can assess relatively between these countries that there is substantial variance in systems across countries and that the presence of a PRTR does not automatically lead to reduce emissions. The focus on risks across these are not necessarily correlated to emissions. Found that US and English system saw consistent reductions in chemicals released into the atmosphere, Canada saw a mix and Australia a rise after PRTR instituted - variable effect. Response strongest in US.\nMatisoff (2013) finds neither state disclosure programmes or the Carbon Disclosure Project (form of civil regulation) in the USA has had a positive impact on carbon intensity or carbon emissions. Considers there may still be a role for ID in conjunction with other policy tools.\nWRAP (2019) - The influence of environmental information may be product dependent. For instance, while a lifespan label influenced choices of washing machines and coffee makers, it did not influence choice of televisions (Jahnich et al. 2016). The addition of running costs to the EU Energy Label was not more effective than just the energy label for vacuum cleaners, fridge freezers or washing machines, but more effective for tumble-dryers (Kalkbekken et al. 2013) and washer-dryers (DECC, 2014).\nA 2023 study by Kantar examining 107 pieces of evidence concluded there is limited evidence of ecolabels greatly influencing consumer and business behaviour, though what data there is shows a small but positive effect (Kantar, 2023).\nAn example in Germany is expanding resource efficiency advice for businesses under the ProgRess programme and contracted out to VDI ZRE - whose product included sector-specific aids, methodologies and information such as resource efficiency checks and process systematisation tools to assist manufacturing enterprises with internal resource efficiency improvement projects. One objective of ProgRess I was the expansion of resource efficiency advice for businesses. Since 2009, with National Climate Initiative funding, BMU/BMUB has contracted out the activities of a Competence Centre for Resource Efficiency. The contract was awarded in 2009, 2012 and 2015 (up to 31 May 2019) to VDI ZRE.\n\n\n\n\n\nCost-effectiveness and efficiency\nEnergy eco-labelling introduced in Europe in 1995 covering 14 domestic and commercial product categories. Goal has been to promote products with better environmental performance on a voluntary basis. Recognized as a (cost) effective policy in driving energy efficiency (TopTen International Services, 2012) in conjunction with ecodesign, in particular."

When eco-design performance requirements were introduced in 1999 in the EU, this weakened consumer comprehension of labels as, for instance, now the worst refrigerators were rated A+ rather than G. Resolved by adding categories first and then scheme rescaled later. The need for rescaling should be anticipated to ensure salience and also to increase their innovatory effect.\nNew Zealand Ministry for the Environment (2023) sets out best practice in communications for waste minimisation in a guide to support effective behaviour change within households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nBawden and Robinson (2008) - Need to ensure information is understandable. An issue highlighted is one of overload, where the information is too much for an individual and it is discarded. There is a real risk of this being the case by adding both an energy efficiency and material efficiency scale (already confusion highlighted in surveys – Waechter et al. 2015).\nWaide et al. (2013) - Assessment of new EU energy labels found the new scale, use of colour, efficiency classification and energy consumption information all assisted comprehension. Room for public education about interpreting the labels however. Better to rescale existing classes than to add new classes as was done in the EU.\nEuropean Environmental Bureau (2015): If a comparative label is adopted, it could be graded on a sliding scale of durability, reparability or lifecycle resource use and an appropriate rating scale is therefore needed. Have to think carefully about what data we want the label to include. Criteria for a comparative label might include: 1) reparability (e.g. availability of spare parts, repair tools and information for repairs); 2) expected product lifespans or the lifespan of key components, the length of product guarantees; 3) upgradability of parts, model, version and brand compatibility; 4) existence of hazardous substances e.g. polybrominated biphenyls in circuit boards; 5) material use i.e. the quantity of materials required for the product. Alternatively, could be presented as an expected product lifespan alone (elicited from firms who are then required to offer a warranty for that period) or annual cost given this expected lifetime (helps standardize).\nJRC (2016) - In a study of material efficiency measures, highlighted it is desirable that EU Ecolabel criteria and Ecodesign requirements are built upon technical analyses of the same features as well and designed as complementary tools to ensure the consistency of diverse policy objectives.\nIdentified ‘hot spots’ or features and characteristics of products that could be improved to facilitate repair, reuse and recycling e.g. the design of battery packs for laptops or for electronic displays, the accessibility to components. Assessing products based on these hot spots could produce a material efficiency score. e.g. the Blue Angle criteria for computer batteries: 1) for life cycle extension focus on whether rechargeable batteries are available for a period of five years from the end of production; 2) for design for recyclability – batteries should be easy to disassemble; 3) for end of life management – information should be provided that batteries should not be disposed of with normal household waste.\nLangley et al. (2012) – In a comparison of the effectiveness of different environmental sustainability information in choice experiments and experimental auctions, found the WTP for washing machines with Energy Labels that had additional carbon footprint data was higher than for machines with an EU Energy Label capturing other impacts. Found adding just one other element of information more effective than several.\nNewell and Siikamaki (2013) found through a choice experiment with alternative labels, that energy efficiency labels were more effective in altering consumer choice when emphasizing cost savings versus physical energy use or carbon emissions. Nevertheless, other analysis e.g. that commissioned by WRAP (2019) on the effectiveness of providing information in encouraging sustainable purchase decisions arrived at the opposite conclusion, finding that although there was robust evidence that energy consumption information can influence purchase behaviour (particularly for the EU Energy Label but varying with other labels and primarily in experimental studies vs. revealed preferences), there was more contested evidence that information on monetary running costs had a positive impact on purchasing decisions."

    "text": "Voluntary environmental instruments have been used increasingly in the UK since the 1990s1, including as part of a wider trend towards ‘better regulation’ (NAO, 2014). A key motivation for their use is attempting to achieve sought outcomes without the need for additional regulation, and in some cases sidestepping inertia that can be associated with the policy-making process (see policy change). Voluntary approaches can be introduced as an alternative to regulation or as a supplement to it (Delmas and Terlaak, 2002). There are examples of voluntary approaches achieving positive change in the UK in relation to CE objectives and those wider, suggesting these can be made to work when well-designed and targeted (OECD, 1999). Voluntary approaches can help address regulatory and data gaps - in some cases with rapidity - and help encourage beyond-compliance improvements to deliver positive net-benefits (Wrap, 2023).\nWhile effective design and implementation can improve the efficacy of these instruments, the effectiveness of voluntary approaches can nevertheless be curtailed by economic limits to voluntarism, as well as a lack of enforceable commitments and scope for non-interaction or free-riding. A willingness to refrain from regulatory approaches in favour of those voluntary may run the risk of reducing government negotiating power in delivering objectives (Rennings et al. 1997). Voluntary approaches should therefore be viewed as a useful complement in a policy mix for CE-related change when well-designed and in the right context (these conditions are further explored here), but not be relied upon solely nor replace existing regulations."

They have come together at the UK Plastics Pact Annual Summit to engage in open conversation and active collaboration to create new and lasting solutions to solve one of the largest challenges of our time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVAs\nThere is evidence of VAs achieving impact. Wrap introduced its first VA in the UK in 2005 and since, has overseen the introduction of several further agreements which have been reported to achieve improvements in their areas of focus. The UK Plastics Pact - a collaboration between 68 retailers, brands, makers of packaging and waste and recycling companies - introduced in 2018 was reported to have achieved an 84% reduction in problematic and unecessary plastics between 2018-21 in unit terms, and a 57% reduction in those products in mass. Further, businesses taking part have been reported to have a higher level of recycled content and use less plastic than the industry average. The Pact also introduced a target for all plastics packaging to be either reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.\nEngland’s Environment Agency also reported improvements through the VAs organised to reduce industrial emissions. For instance, ‘there was a 17% reduction in overall emissions reported during TP4 from the 53 sectors in the CCA scheme.’ (EA, 2023).\nCourtauld 2025 (C2025) aims to achieve a 20% per capita reduction in UK food and drink waste associated with production and consumption by 2025, relative to 2015 levels. 2018 data appears to show progress is on track to achieve this objective: ‘per capita food waste generated in the United Kingdom, including inedible parts, fell by approximately 7% between 2015 and 2018, from 154 kg to 143 kg. In the same period, it is estimated that there has been a 7% per capita reduction in annual GHG emissions associated with food and drink consumed in the United Kingdom’ (Defra, 2022).\nFrance achieved as significant decrease in the use of SUPBs (from 10.5 billion in 2002 to 800 million in 2013) via the use of voluntary initiatives that focused on promoting reusable shopping bags (as was (Muposhi, Mpinganjira and Wait, 2022). Nevertheless, in 2016 SUPBs were banned and many retails introduced a small charge on alternative paper bags provided in place.\nVAs have been shown to deliver benefits elsewhere. For instance, the Dutch Target Group Policy, comprising a series of negotiated agreements with industry has been generally regarded as successful in achieving emission reductions. Asensio & Magali (2017) find participants in the US Department of Energy’s Better Building Challenge programme in LA, which provides energy audits to support US commercial and industrial building owners who commit to reducing energy and water consumption, achieved energy savings of 18.7% via building technology upgrades. A key argument put forward for the effectiveness of VAs relates to the rapidity with which they can achieve objectives. Goodwin (2015) and Sitra (2019) argue that voluntary instruments such as VAs and VIS can offer a faster way to bring about action by avoiding the legal process (Goodwin, 2015; Sitra, 2019). VAs can also enable action across value chains as opposed to in a single area (Wrap).\nNot all studies paint the effectiveness of VAs in such a positive light. In a meta-study of UK VAs, McCarthy and Morling (2015) found 82% of reviewed VAs scored poorly in relation to either: 1) level of uptake (participation rate); 2) target ambition (the stringency of the targets relative to the policy objective); or 3) target achievement (the extent to which voluntary targets are realised). A 1999 review by the OECD found that although ‘stipulated environmental targets are generally met, the achievement is [often] driven by factors other than the agreement itself – in other words firms would have done what the agreement stipulates even in its absence.’ (OECD, 1999).\nThere is also a need to consider the activities of non-signatories by comparison to understand the overall impact and approximate the ‘do nothing’ option. Berlin and Prakash (2015) find participants in the Global Compact perform worse than non-participants on costly environmental and human rights performance aspects and show improvements on only more superficial dimensions. Marx and Cuypers (2010) found the Forest Stewarship Council (FSC) had a limited impact in halting deforestation, not least because of the limited number of countries with FSC certification, particularly, large developing ones with significant forest areas experiencing high rates of forest degradation and loss. The EU’s negotiated CO2 agreements with car-makers were not on track to meet required targets and have since been replaced by standards.\nRegarding average effects per participant, for negotiated agreements in particular, regulations/standards may need to be set at the level of the lowest common denominator, retarding the development of more ambitious environmental policy. One critique is that VAs may perversely recognise the wrong firms, with such adverse selection occurring as a result of firms seeking to ‘gain signaling and insurance benefits without putting forth the required effort’ (Lenox and Nash 2003: 344). In the UK context, Morakinyo and Stathopoulou (2021) found that firms with lower levels of environmental efficiency received higher CCA tax discounts (Morakinyo and Stathopoulou, 2021).\nThe EMF’s “Global Commitment” voluntary initiative for companies to reduce single-use plastic showed in its most recent annual report that members have made limited progress in reducing virgin plastic use since 2018 and with a high likelihood of missing 2025 targets for reusable, recyclable and compostable packaging (EMF, 2022).\nA 2011 review of the effectiveness of voluntary agreements in the publication ‘the Economics of Wase and Waste Policy’ found ‘empirical evidence suggests that voluntary approaches are not likely to be as effective as pricing instruments in delivering significant behaviour change’.\nDefra’s Resources and Waste highlights the activities of ‘VinylPlus’ - a European-wide Industry voluntary commitment representing the whole value chain of the PVC industry and with the aim of achieving 800,000 tonnes recycled annually across Europe by 2020. Though this figure was missed in the target year, it has since been reached in 2021 and 2022 (VinylPlus, 2023), with an estimated 35% recycling rate now estimated to be achieved across Europe and reduction in the emissions intensity and energy consumption of production of 14.4% and 9.5% between 2007-08 and 2015-16. The scheme has also further developed recycled PVC measurement systems by tracking both how much PVC waste has been recycled by recyclers and converters and how much recycled PVC has been used in new products.\n\n\nVIS\nEMS such as the ISO 14000 series are arguably the most widely adopted form of voluntary corporate environmental policy (Darnall, 2008), with x certifications issued globally. These function by seeking to embed specific practices in firm operations such that environmental protection become integral to activities (Darnall, 2008). The success of their uptake has been attributed to their flexible, procedural-based approach given they do not specify substantive improvements (Testa et al. ).\nEMAS is a ‘voluntary EU environmental management scheme to enable organisations to evaluate, report and improve their environmental performance.’ introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93 (European Court of Auditors, 2023). A 2017 review by the European Commission found that ‘although registered organisations generally benefitted from EMAS in environmental terms, they struggled to reduce their waste generation and material consumption, which even increased in some cases’ (EC, 2017 in European Court of Auditors, 2023).\nThere is evidence of the uptake of VIS in firms leading to a reduction in waste generated (Melynk et al. 2003), wastewater management (Darnall and Kim, 2012), resource use (Rao & Hammer, 1999), and certain emissions (Szymanski & Tiwari, 2004; Darnall, Henriquez and Sadorsky, 2008). ISO 14001 adoption led to a reduction in toxic emissions in electronic plants in Canada (Russo, 2009). A meta-analysis of 94 studies found a generally positive relationship between the uptake of ISO 14001 and indicators of improved management practice and employee awareness.\nHowever, the impacts of ISO certification have been argued to be substantively small in most cases (Coglianese and Nash, 2001) and a more ambiguous relationship between the adoption of EMS and indicators environmental performance has been found in several studies. King et al. (2005) found there to be no effect on environmental performance among US manufacturing firms of ISO 14001 certification. In Sweden, Zobel found no statistically significant difference between ISO certified and non-certified manufacturing firms holding for prior environmental performance, with adopting firms seeing some positive effects on energy use and waste generation/treatment, whereas non-adopting firms performed better for air emissions. Barla (2007) found worse environmental outcomes in Canadian pulp and paper mills after certification. The Europe-wide EMS (EMAS) was found to be associated with symbolic behaviour among firms in Spain examined rather than genuine performance improvements (Martín de Castro et al. 2017).\nThis can be seen as due to several features of VIS including that targets are self-created - meaning they can be more readily limited in aspiration, including being constrained by their voluntary nature.\n\n\nPublic voluntary challenges\nBehavioural effects of Food Waste Reduction Week ( ) for those that it reached was around 60% (Wrap, 2023).\n\n\n\n\nReviews have generally shown that voluntary initiatives benefit only when confined to soft issues, though this is not always the case. Reasons for a lack of effectiveness can include: scope for free-riding; non-enforceable nature of the agreements; and a lack of transparency. Voluntary approaches can be characterized by being too unambitious, with levels of abatement premised on goodwill or rational self-enlightenment. As opportunities for painless pollution prevention have been increasingly exhausted for some time (Walley and Whitehead, 1994).\n\n\nCost-effectiveness and efficiency\nSeveral studies have shown a positive net present value of voluntary agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a history of voluntary initiatives seeking to improve the environmental performance of textiles produced and consumed in the UK. The Sustainable Clothing Roadmap established by Defra in 2007, involved over 300 companies in an attempt to increase sustainability throughout the clothing supply chain (Defra, 2009) including through maximising the reuse and recycling of fibres. The linked Sustainable Clothing Action Plan updated in 2010 set out agreed stakeholder actions (Defra, 2011) across priority areas including consumption trends and behaviour; awareness raising; creating market drivers; and improving traceability, and worked through ‘coordinating’ action by stakeholders. Building off these, the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan 2020 Commitment (SCAP) voluntary agreement launched in 2012 by Wrap sought to further improve the environmental and social performance of the UK clothing system. The SCAP 2020 Final Report found the benefit to cost ratio of the textiles-focussed VA running to 2020 was 2:1. The Textiles 2030 Agreement, also coordinated by Wrap was launched in 2022.\nAlso coordinated by Wrap, VAs established as part of the Courtauld 2025 Agreement focussed on reducing waste and improving wider environmental performance in the agri-food sector (making up around 10% of UK GVA) were estimated to have a benefit to cost ratio of 6:1 with costs estimated to be in the range of 0.3-0.8Bn GBP including costs to government for sponsoring the agreement and in foregone Landfill Tax revenue (Wrap, 2020). This set of agreements were since replaced by Courtauld 2030 in 2021, which increased the ambition of targets (Wrap, 2022).\nThe UK National Industrial Symbiosis Programme was a free at point-of-receipt, advice and networking programme managed by a private company ‘International Synergies’, which sought to facilitate industrial symbiosis3 and identify sustainable resource management solutions for business. After the trialling of three pilot schemes in 2003 in Scotland, West Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside, the programme received £27 million funding from Defra over three years to roll it out across nine English regions and was operational to approximately 2013 and was discontinued due to failure to establish a commercial model. Similar programmes were also initiated in Wales, N.Ireland & Scotland (SISP) (International Synergies,). Estimated benefits of the programme from 2005-2013 in England include 47 million tonnes of landfill diversion, 42 million tonnes of CO2 reduced and 45 million tonnes of materials recovered and reused, as well as cost-savings of over a billion pounds and 10,000 jobs. Manchester Economics assessed the programme as having a cost-benefit ratio of between 32:1 and 53:1 (Scott et al. 2016).\nIn addition, there may be ‘hedging’ benefits to the use of VAs. In a context of uncertainty regarding potential costs of regulation, voluntary agreements can give the opportunity to begin environmental improvements with less risks of costs outweighing benefits and with greater flexibility (Defra, 2011)."

From the perspective of government, VAs ‘can be set up without the need for new legislation’ and therefore avoid associated resource costs including collecting information and required labour inputs (Wrap, 2021; Frey, 1997; Bauer, Busch and Tuncer, 2023). At the same time, VAs can require government funding either directly or indirectly and funding models for previous ventures generally resemble projects rather than longer-term programmes. Comparatively and for EMS, costs to government for routes by which they can leverage support e.g. via endorsement activities, are likely to be relatively small or non-existent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, financial resources may be required. The costs of negotiating and administering VAs as part of the US EPA’s Project XL were estimated to be $450,000 per firm (Blackman & Mazurek (2001). The UK NISP programme was associated with an exchequer cost of £27 million public funding for NISP. When public funding was reduced, the programme was terminated despite high reported BCA.\nWRAP Electrical and Electronic Equipment Sustainability Action Plan (ESAP) : ‘Seeks to catalyse sector action, share evidence and bring the many different stakeholders to provide tangible economic and environmental benefits’ (Defra, 2014). A voluntary agreement with 74 signatories which focusses on extending product durability through design and encouraging new business models keeping products in circulation for longer. WRAP was unable to meet their business plan targets for funding from businesses and governments to progress interventions in the sector."

    "text": "Positive and negative spillovers\n‘Spillovers’ are the effects on actors other than participants of VIs, which can occur through dynamics such as: the diffusion of technology; improved data, metrics and transparency; reductions in defensive expenditures by regulated parties and government legal costs; and and crowding in of intrinsic motivations (Frey, 1997).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, can fosters positive commitments to achieve shared goals amongst firms, and in doing so reduces resistance, resentment and defensive expenditures by regulated parties, crowds in the intrinsic motivation of regulated agents and reduces governments’ legal costs (Frey, 1997). Can help exploits firms’ knowledge, resources and innovative capabilities, helping them develop new capabilities. Can reduces the need for mandatory regulation, its associated informational and cost requirements e.g. regarding best available processes or technologies and associated regulatory costs for governments while helping fill ‘gaps’ in existing regulatory systems (Blackman et al. 2012).\nVAs may help to increase trust.\nCan be used to build state regulatory capacity e.g. Law 99 in Colombia was followed by 65 VAs which sought to establish more co-operative relationships between firms and promote information exchange between themselves and industry to advance environmental performance in the absence of well-functioning C&C regulations, while facilitating the development of regulatory capacity (Blackman et al. 2012). Also applies to new areas in which to apply regulation. Supports learning, and helps preventing Type II errors where incorrect interventions are made.\nFirms also can hold their supply chains to their EMS standards, alleviating pressures on government regulatory costs and extending governance beyond the remit of firms in international settings (Darnall, Henriquez and Sadorsky, 2008). In the pressure-treated wood industry, Hsueh (2013) found an association between reductions in chromated copper arsenate as covered by VAs with the EPA and a reduction in arsenic levels otherwise not covered by the agreement indicating the potential for cross-media impacts.\nSelf-reflection in firms through applying VIS and the monitoring of nonconformities, computerisation of environmental management systems and more systematic auditing can help overcome willful ignorance and led to better compliance with other regulation (Boiral, 2011; Potoski & Prakash, 2005). This has been shown in China among firms adopting ISO 14001 certifications (McGuire, 2014), though also no effect was found between certifications and compliance with the UK’s Integrated Pollution Prevention & Control Regime (Dahlstrom et al. 2003). Dahlstrom et al. (2003) find certification improved only procedural aspects of UK manufacturing plants rather than legal compliance, numbers of complaints etc. Even therefore if we support the benefits of EMS, the efficacy of regulatory relief remains unclear.\nEMS can reduce costs of compliance with other laws by introducing standardized environmental audits acknowledged by the state. Can be used to fulfill requirements of national legislation and thus reduce compliance costs for both the state and companies.\nHowever, negative spillovers with the regulatory system and long-term environmental improvement may also arise. This can be due to the adoption of more modest improvements voluntarily leading to regulators not imposing further requirements, even where environmental beneficial and economically efficient such as was found to occur in Leon, Mexico with negotiated agreements between tanneries and the state (Blackman, 2008)."

Today, voluntary action is explicitly or tacitly encouraged by UK governments across a range of areas, suggesting a high level of ‘strategic fit’ with current government preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been a push for greater consideration of the potential of extra-regulatory options to achieve objectives across governments in the UK in recent years.

A 2022 OECD snapshot of UK CE progress recommends “continuing and enhance initiatives for private sector action on circular economy, including support for voluntary agreements, innovative research and co-operation with local authorities and civil society.”\nHowever, there are risks to relying on voluntary approaches for the following reasons.

As facilitators, those bodies can support system thinking to ensure coherence across sectors, enable collaboration and dialogue and work with industry and other actors to develop, for example, industry roadmaps. They can also provide enabling functions such as allocating financial stimulus to support the innovation process, capacity building across the public and private sector and introducing publicly accessible information, monitoring and evaluation systems based on robust data and incisive metrics (OECD, 2021b).\n\n\nFigure 5.

    "text": "Wider business ecosystem stakeholders\nStarting from the outermost concentric ring in the ecosystem model, ‘wider business ecosystem’ stakeholders such as government/state bodies, non-governmental organisations and academia can shape and parameterise the landscape in which value-chain-activities occur in various ways and in many cases, have a mandate or responsibility to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Central government\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 80% of UK business leaders surveyed in a 2022 poll agreed that government policies are required to bring about the economy-wide changes needed to tackle climate change, as a closely linked area to the CE (CISL, 2022). Regulation is often thought about solely as control by a government furthermore, with the OECD (2021a) defining regulation as ‘instruments by which governments set requirements on enterprises and citizens’. Given their responsibilities and resources, primary avenues of influence available to central governments across the UK include:\n\nthe ability to issue legislative and policy instruments prescribing or prohibiting certain behaviours or technical conditions;\nthe distribution or redistribution of financial and other resources which can enable activities to be undertaken;\nthe means to collate and generated information by being in the centre of knowledge networks; and\nthe capacity to create organisations conducting activities such as public bodies or committees (Steurer, 2013; Duit, 2014). This includes at the international level such as participating in the G7 Alliance on Resource Efficiency.\n\nSince the 1990s, many areas of law and policymaking relating to waste and resource management have been devolved across the countries making up the UK. This means that central government departments with jurisdictions relating to CE exist not only in the UK Government (as the central executive authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) but also in the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive - though devolution has been asymmetrical in the powers devolved across the four nations. With devolution, different stated objectives relating to the CE, approaches to achieve objectives and varying levels of activity have also emerged (OECD, 2022; Zils et al. 2023).\nKey strategies published by governments across the UK include, the Defra 2018 Resources and Waste Strategy for England recently updated by the report ’Maximising Resources, Minimising Waste, which sets out the future actions government will take to maximise resources and minimise waste across key resource intensive sectors such as construction, textiles, food and drink, packaging and electricals. Scotland’s firs CE strategy was published in 2016, Making things last, while a Scottish Circular Economy Bill was published in June 2023, with proposals for statutory targets and indicators to measure progress towards reducing waste and the national carbon footprint. The Welsh Government published its Circular Economy Beyond Recycling report in June 2021, to track progress of their circular economy strategy. Beyond Recycling included indicators to scale up prevention and re-use, and placed circular economy beyond a purely material focus by linking to the national indicators under the Well being of Future Generations Act. The Northern Ireland Department for the Economy is currently consulting on a circular economy strategy for NI, with a focus on innovation, sustainable production and consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Local authorities and cities\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of local government varies by country in the UK, with N. Ireland, Scotland and Wales having a single level of local government bodies while in England there is a combination of single-tier authorities in some areas and two-tiers of local government in others (OECD, 2022). Local authorities (LA) across the UK (referred to as local councils in N. Ireland) have statutory responsibility for council services including the collection and treatment of local-authority collected waste (LACW) and street sweepings (Rezaie et al. 2022). Historically, LAs organised as either individual or combined waste collection and/or disposal authorities have had localised discretion over budgetary allocations for waste management, materials collected, how frequently and treatment arrangements (Abbott, Nandeibam and O’Shea, 2011). There has been a move to greater consistency of these aspects in recent years through The 2021 Environment Act covering England and with similar interventions planned or in place in Scotland, Wales and N. Ireland.\nIn addition to potentially altering council services for which they are responsible, LAs as well as regional bodies and cities can help provide other enabling conditions for a CE transition (Figure 11) (EMF, 2019). This includes through setting ambition and direction (e.g. theWest Midlands’ Circular Economy Routemap), community engagement, financial resource allocation, advice and in-kind support (e.g.ReLondon’s Business Transformation programme), planning, the management of public assets and as a purchaser of goods and services. Reports submitted by signatories to theCircular Cities Declaration show key trends including growing national and supra-national support to cities, the adoption of circular strategies and roadmaps to steer the transition (Abu-Bakar, 2023), investment in infrastructure, using public procurement to achieve objectives, establishing innovation programmes and projects and empowering citizens with a particular focus on the construction and food sectors (CCD, 2022).\n\n\nUrban policy levers for circular economy transitions (EMF, 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Non-governmental organisations and civil society\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough growth in opportunities for participation in the policymaking process and outside of it, civil society actors have acquired greater status in the landscape of environmental regulation. ‘Civil society’ broadly refers to stakeholders (interacting as) neither the government nor market and which includes the general public and those organised. Organised publics in the form of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) perform a variety of regulatory and steering functions relevant to the CE that include:\n\nInputting to agenda-setting and policy formulation via government facilitated routes of engagement such as consultations and outside of these;1\nCollecting, analysing and disseminating information e.g. to monitor compliance;\nCoordinating with other actors e.g. the Circular Economy Task Force convened by the Green Alliance to broker greater collaboration within sectors, improve product design and company reporting;\nPressurising firms and the government (such as through organising boycotts or legal routes e.g. the work of Client Earth) and whistle-blowing; and\nDeveloping localised schemes, including inputting to production activities (Maitre-Ekern and Dalhammar, 2019).\n\nIn addition, NGO influence has increasingly taken on new forms such as establishing unilateral partnerships with firms and creating, promulgating and monitoring formalised standards. In many cases, this has arisen through the need to fill regulatory gaps emerging e.g., at the international level, such as the Forest Stewardship Council2 (Klooster, 2005) and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. Particularly prominent NGOs in the CE area include those closely tied to UK government bodies such as WRAP and Zero Waste Scotland as well as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the Green Alliance, Business in the Community and Circle Economy. Philanthropic groups which blur the line between public and private can too be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Intergovernmental bodies\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequent global nature of environmental issues and upward scalar shifts in the governance landscape has seen supranational bodies at the international and regional levels take increasingly key positions in trying to tackle environmental pressures due to human activities. For instance, the United Nations’ Environmental Programme (UNEP) has played a role in coordinating international scientific advisory bodies such as the IPCC and establishing international frameworks for climate change mitigation and adaptation, desertification and biodiversity. UNEP also has an important role in brokering information (e.g. the Global Material Flows database) and wider thought leadership.\nAnother particularly active supranational body in the area of CE is the World Economic Forum (WEF), with programmes developed including the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) which works to develop commitments towards the circular economy via a range of value-chain partnerships. Other international bodies such as the World Bank are now active in this area through the production of reports and other outputs (World Bank, 2022). Many international agencies and organisations covering finance, shipping, energy and food production also have the potential to contribute to more circular and sustainable practices via their own routes of influence.\nAt a regional level, the UNECE is leading on many CE issues such as relating to data and value chain mapping, whilst the Circular Step3 dialogue platform brings together CE focal points from over 27 UN countries to exchange policy developments, innovations, evidence of what works on the ground and build capacity to mobilise actions at various scales and sectoral ambitions, with the CE-Hub acting on behalf of the UK. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and OECD are also preparing joint guidelines on measuring circular economy,4comprising core and complementary indicators, with a view to developing implementation guidelines in 2024.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Education, research and training providers\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking a shift from a linear to a circular economy represents a profound shift in the way we think about and the actions we all take in every facet of the economy and society. To make such a transformation requires education and training from preschool through to post 16 technical training, university education, apprenticeships, in-work skills and training programmes, as well as informal lifelong learning for everyone. Countries such as Finland (Tiippana-Usvasalo et al. 2023) have started this process, and case examples can be found in schools, colleges and universities and many businesses through organisations supported by the EMF.6\nOvercoming barriers to, and designing enablers for, CE adoption and implementation will require new technologies, scientific solutions, social innovations, engineering and manufacturing systems, digital and data-driven approaches. This requires a clear focus on impact and outcomes at various scales, while dealing with complex and contested trade-offs and systems shifts as CE scales up. To overcome these barriers, an engaged research community is required. This includes universities, companies, government departments, NGOs and citizen groups, combining and collaborating in new, inter and trans-disciplinary formations. Collaborations should hold a shared or consistent perspective on the end states to maximise the potential from CE. Academic researchers and research programmes such as NICER, contribute to, among other things, the ability to evaluate and evidence the benefits, costs and risks of different CE options, including at the direct request of government policymakers."

    "section": "The extended enterprise",
    "text": "The extended enterprise\nThe ‘extended enterprise’ consists of organisations such as auditors and standardisation bodies, testing labs, logistics and insurance firms and technology providers who through their activities, goods and services support, administer and enable value chains to operate and function. We outline the potential role of several of these actors below, while other relevant actors to CE transformation include ratings agencies and wider service suppliers such as the insurance sector (Farkova et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Standardisation bodies\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardisation bodies help unify terminology and play an important role in providing frameworks and guidance to support, among other things, consistent testing, measurement, inspection and validation assessments as well as the uptake of relevant product requirements and information provision as part of environmental management standards. All of these can support the development of a more circular UK economy, including through the more efficient exchange of information between market actors by removing ambiguity in terms used, building trust and reducing risk.\nAn example of a private standards-issuing body is the British Standards Institution (BSI). BSI standards are typically broad in nature (covering e.g. principles and terminology) and for use by technical committees or actors when producing their own horizontal, generic or product-specific standards. Examples of BSI standards relevant to the circular economy include:\n\nBS 8001:2017 – Provides a framework for applying circular economy principles in organisations; and product-group specific frameworks e.g. for electronics:\n\nBS EN 45552:2020 - General method for the assessment of the durability of energy-related products;\nBS EN 45555:2019 - General methods for assessing the recyclability and recoverability of energy-related products; and\nBS EN IEC 62474:2019 - Material declaration for products of and for the electrotechnical industry.\n\n\nIn addition, the widely used ISO family of industry-based environmental management standards have been extended to include circular economy guidance such as:\n\nISO 59020 – Provides a framework for measuring and assess circularity in organisations; and\nISO 59000 – To set a conceptual framework of terms, measures, and indicators relating to the CE concept.\n\nISO and BSI standards are voluntarily adopted and maintained by private organisations. They are also widely accepted by public actors, adding to their perceived legitimacy and are therefore sometimes referred to as a form of ‘hybrid governance’ between actors (Falkner, 2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Technology providers\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology providers can work to fill new markets generated by government regulation or proactively offer a technology solution to core market actors and those throughout the business ecosystem. Government has an important role here, in regulating claims and in providing a stable environment for innovation and reducing investment uncertainty. Innovate UK, for example is the UK’s national innovation agency, who support business-led innovation in all sectors, technologies and UK regions and provide private investor insights (Innovate UK, 2023). Private sector entities can also anticipate future government regulation or otherwise. For example, QSA is a CE business modelling company, funded by IUK through the NICER CR&D fund to develop data-led evidence to support future EPR for the British Fashion sector.7 Examples of relevant technology providers include those working in the area of data (e.g., distributed ledgers, AI, IoT, sensors), for example, SAP and Topolytics, who offer products to support improved material tracing and internal accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Finance sector\n\n\n\n\n\nWith money the lifeblood of market-based economies such as the UK, the finance sector holds a strategic role in driving a more circular economy. Public equity, private market funds and wider debt and equity instruments are frequently needed to develop and scale CE interventions, while a lack of finance frequently is quoted as a barrier to scaling or innovation in the first place (Mähönen, 2019). Investments in the linear economy can also run counter to CE aims, suggesting the need for a reconfiguration in places. Investor action on the circular economy is relatively nascent, but as with climate considerations, may be expected to come in the form of commitments and policies by firms and bodies in the finance sector as well as the uptake of metrics and ESG criteria (UN PRI, 2022). Central banks and wider financial supervisory bodies ranging from the international to national scale can also contribute to aligning the financial sector with societal objectives given their uniquely close links to capital markets (Couto, 2023)."

    "text": "Core market actors\nCore market (CM) actors including producers such as raw material providers, manufacturers and recyclers on the one hand and consumers on the other, are bound together through the production, processing and use of products along a given value chain.\n\nProducers\nIn the CE-Hub’s value chain taxonomy, core-market actors undertaking production activities across the linear value chain from mining through to product distribution, collection and disposal are primarily non-financial corporations as well as households as producing units (B2B, B2C and B2G). For reverse loop activities, non-financial corporations and households (as producers) are too particularly active, but as are NGOs/NPISHs and government bodies in some cases. Shifts in business models have been conceptualized in different ways, ranging from symbolic and philanthropic on one end to integrative and finally innovative or transformative - though the development of new business models to solve issues and leverage CE approaches for competitive advantage (Clarkson, 1995; Halme and Laurila, 2008; Hopkinson and Zils, 2023a; 2023b). The adoption of more circular business models can occur at the firm or industry level in the absence of regulation for reasons including (Ambec and Lanoie, 2008; EMF, 2015):\n\nReducing production costs and increasing competitiveness;\nGaining differentiation advantages and entering new markets to increase sales and revenues;\nEstablishing a positive corporate image and brand integrity;\nManaging risks threatening financial returns, including on the supply side to physical inputs or financing, on the demand-side such as changing preferences and from wider stakeholders e.g. regulators; and\nInfluences from organizational culture and normative drivers, including non-instrumental values.\n\nWe explore the role of key production sectors further below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Extractive and processing industry\n\n\n\n\n\nMetallic mineral extraction to meet UK demand for metals is almost if not entirely met by overseas extraction currently, with no domestic extraction of iron ore reported to have taken place in the UK since 2008, UK domestic extraction of non-ferrous metals in 2021 standing at just 1,300 metric tonnes and no bauxite/other alumina nor copper reported to have been extracted in the UK over the 30 year period since 1992 (ONS, 2023a). In 2021, mining and quarrying of non-metallic minerals contributed £19.5 billion to UK GVA, with 205 million tonnes of non-metallic minerals extracted in the same year and of which over 90% was sand, gravel, limestone and gypsum. 70.4 million tonnes of ‘fossil energy materials/carriers’ were also extracted in the UK in 2020 (ONS, 2023). While industrial mineral extraction in the UK makes up a relatively small proportion of national GVA, foundational industries such as chemicals, ceramics, paper, glass and cement process large quantities of materials (e.g. around 28 million tonnes of material output per annum in the UK) and emit 50 million tonnes of CO2 per year, or 10% of the total CO2 emitted by UK homes and businesses. Changes in production practices in line with CE principles among these industries may hold decarbonization potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Farming, Forestry and Fisheries\n\n\n\n\n\nAgriculture, forestry and fishing contributed approximately 3 billion GBP to UK GVA in 2021, with 136 million tonnes of biomass extraction/cultivation taking place in the UK in 2021, 95% of which was crops or crops residue and 6 million tonnes of wood (ONS, 2023a). Approximately 71% of UK landcover is managed by farmers and other land managers and these activities have a significant impact on people’s health, access to the countryside, land, air and water quality and biodiversity. Agricultural, forestry and fishing practices impact on energy and material inputs furthermore (fertilisers, pesticides, automation), wildlife and fishery populations and the benefits of numerous ecosystem services. Developments around regenerative agriculture (EMF, n.d.), blue economy (LSE, 2023) and nature-based approaches to flood risk (Hopkinson et al. forthcoming) highlight the potential for applying CE principles to the biological sphere of the economy, for higher overall value creation across many different value chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Manufacturers\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Manufacturing’ covers a broad number of activities, ranging from the creation of highly specialised metal components for aerospace to the production of fast fashion garments. The manufacturing sector forms a key component of the UK economy, with manufacturing product sales at £429.8 billion in 2022, and over 2.5 million people employed (ONS, 2023d; ONS, 2023e). Linear business models in the manufacturing phase involves a company procuring and sourcing raw materials, components, and semi-finished products from the upstream market and employing labour, capital and knowledge inputs to assemble and deliver products sold to users or consumers in a downstream market with little consideration for value recovery. The nature of competition in a linear throughput arrangement typically leads to two issues:\n\nlow cost, point of sales, transaction focus (versus quality or longevity)\nno systematic end-of-use recovery and re-circulation of value\n\nIn many cases, there is no natural incentive for manufacturers to improve durability and/or to design products to be of higher (perceived) value at end of use. For some materially intensive products, such as a car, the embedded value of products at end of use is apparent and substantial and there are many value loops that take advantage of the residual value at the end of customer use. These include second-hand car dealerships, repair and refurbishment shops. At the end of product life there are very widely established scrap metal dealerships and recycling operations that capture value from the components and raw materials. For many other products however, there is no natural incentive for manufacturers to design products to maintain their value, resulting in limited revalorisation opportunities. An important example of this structural market leakage is in plastic packaging or plastic use in general where an estimated market value in excess of $80-$120 billion is disposed of every year (EMF, n.d.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Startups and SMEs\n\n\n\n\n\nA key barrier to more circular practices in businesses is the economics as well as technical and additional aspects (explored further in Section 4) which mean incumbent firms, especially larger businesses can’t be relied upon alone to integrate CE practices and government at speed. Start-ups and SMEs, which make up the larger majority of businesses in all national economies, can be more agile and able to spot opportunity, take risks or fail fast, and therefore have the potential to develop potential key solutions. NICER CECs and the CE-Hub have featured and showcased many innovative start-ups and SMEs operating in different sectors and value chain segments, including through Collaborative Research and Development funding with Innovate UK. Trade bodies, such as AMDEA and network organization, such as Federation of Small Business, provide important gateways to reach this huge, diverse, and often difficult to reach sector of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Retailers\n\n\n\n\n\nRetailers act as the interface between producers and consumers, influencing demand for goods and services and how they are delivered. Retailers are therefore subject to a range of pressures, with growing environmental awareness, stakeholder pressures and government rules and regulations reportedly encouraging e.g. UK retailers to embrace circular business models in their operations in some sectors (Upadhyay, Kumar & Akter, 2021). Retailers can also influence post-consumption phases through the adoption and promotion of alternative business to the traditional sales-ownership transaction. Various forms of pre-competitive collaboration can be seen among these actors such as the ‘Retailer Net-Zero Collaborative Action Plan’ facilitated by WRAP and WWF to align carbon accounting approaches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Waste management companies\n\n\n\n\n\nWaste management companies are a key group who manage and coordinate the collection, processing and disposal of products and materials from different economic sectors and households, frequently on behalf of LAs. They do so as private entities ranging from small-medium enterprises (SMEs) to multinational corporations, for whom the need to generate profit including via markets for secondary materials, drives investment and interest in public and private sector contracts. Recycling, waste and wastewater management activities in the UK generated a gross value added (GVA) of £16.1 billion in 2020 and were associated with 156,000 FTE job roles (ONS, 2023c). Data on the flows of wastes held by many of these companies also form a key building block for understanding the quantity, quality, spatial distribution and disposal pathways for products and materials of interest. It should be noted that the environmental performance of waste management companies varies significantly and criminality within the sector is increasing (Environment Agency, 2021).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reverse loop sectors\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile aligning the UK economy with CE principles can be expected to involve changes in the practices of industries already represented along value chains such as manufacturers and retailers, structural shifts can be also be anticipated in other areas of the economy including the emergence of new sectors. For example, a growth in an assortment of activities which constitute the CE’s ‘reverse loops’ and involve resource flows otherwise discarded, being intercepted and processed in a way that retains the value of materials, components or products in the economy, including collection. There are various schema to classify reverse loops, including the following activities (based on Cramer (2017) and Kirchherr, Reike and Hekkert (2017)):\n\nMaintenance/repair – fixing a defective product so it can be used with its original function;\nReuse/resale - a further use of a product still in good condition;\nRefurbishment - restoring an old product for further use;\nRemanufacturing - using parts of discarded products within a new product with the same function; and\nRecycling - processing products or components into their constituent materials to obtain the same (high grade) or lower (low grade) quality.\n\nIt should nevertheless be highlighted that maintaining or circulating materials and products that are toxic, hazardous, or more environmentally damaging than new products is inconsistent with foundational CE principles.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumers\nIn addition to influencing value-chain activities as citizens through exercising the right to vote, advocacy or reputation shaming, households can also drive change through their consumption behaviours (Newell, 2008). For instance, consumers may: move patronage to a retailer who offers refillable solutions; purchase second-hand or remanufactured goods instead of new; or buy products less often and seek out repair opportunities for goods currently held. The responsiveness of consumers is a key determinant of the effectiveness of interventions such as mandatory information disclosure via labelling furthermore. Environmentally significant household behaviour change can be classified in different ways, including, for example, the avoid-shift-improve model based on:\n\nAvoiding unnecessary consumption or impactful behaviour e.g. reducing food waste;\nShifting consumption activities to less environmentally impactful alternatives e.g. sharing instead of buying new; and\nImproving environmental performance of activity in question e.g., using BEVs instead of ICEs.\n\nOf the actors outlined, central and local government though not the only source of regulatory authority/capacity, have a prominent and critical role in the regulatory landscape for a UK CE. This including through an ability to issue laws, redistribute resources, provide services and set direction. The next section therefore looks in more detail at the instruments available to these bodies to drive change."

PMBIs are most effective for products whose demand or output is sensitive to price change i.e. demand is elastic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial inflow taxation and charges\nIn theory, increasing the price of primary resources can be expected to reduce the environmental pressures associated with their consumption. This can occur through: 1) reducing the use of resource inputs into production and consumption processes; and 2) driving input substitution away from primary materials towards those secondary (Government Office for Science, 2014).\nThe UK Aggregates Levy introduced in 2002 had the dual aim of reducing the negative environmental impacts of quarrying and increasing the recycling rate of construction materials by making the costs of virgin material inputs more costly (Ettlinger, 2022).2 Between 2002 and 2018, total aggregation consumption has fallen while the share of aggregates from secondary sources increased (MPA, 2019) - implying also an absolute decoupling of construction industry output from primary material input. However, these impacts are difficult to attribute to the levy alone (Ettlinger 2022), with secondary aggregate consumption on an upward trend prior to the introduction of the Levy, and potentially also linked to the Landfill Tax (introduced in 1996) which encouraged the creation of secondary markets.\nA 2011 meta-study of virgin material taxation schemes found these reduced the domestic supply of virgin materials when in place, but often only led to limited increase in the use of recycled materials as virgin materials could be sourced overseas (Söderholm, 2011).\nRecycled and secondary materials in total aggregates sales in Great Britain (Million tonnes) (MPA, 20 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData published by Wrap showed 12.2 billion single-use carrier bags (SUCB) were used by customers across UK supermarkets in 2006. Wales introduced a 5p charge per SUCB in 2011, followed by N. Ireland in 2013, Scotland in 2014 and in 2015 in England through the statutory instrument Single Use Carrier Bags Charges (England) Order 2015 No. 776. At the time of introduction, the charge in England was expected to save GBP60m savings in litter clean-up costs and GBP13m in carbon savings (Centre for Public Impact, 2016).\nThe charge on single use carrier bags in England - initially introduced at 5p and since 2021 increased to 10p while being extended to all shops, has seen a significant decrease in the number of single use bags issued by retailers of approximately 80% (Defra, 2022).\nBags issued by reportees in England, by bag type (million) (Defra (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd-of-life taxation and charges\nThe Landfill Tax was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1996 and applied to all waste disposed of at a licensed landfill site in an attempt to better reflect environmental costs of landfilling in its price, and in doing so, reduce waste entering landfill and associated environmental impact. The tax has since been devolved to Scotland and Wales (OBR, 2023).\nA review shortly after the introduction of the tax found it had led to a modest reduction in waste to landfill from industry, but not by households (Morris, Phillips and Read, 1998) and that quantities of waste landfilled remained relatively stable between 1996 and 2003 (Elliot, 2016). With annual rate increases, LACW sent to landfill in England fell by an estimated 90% between 2000 and 2021, while total waste landfill (including non-household waste), has also fallen albeit at a slower pace.\nA 2021 study by Panzone et al.using a ridge-regression approach, found the tax has been effective in shifting waste generated to alternative end-destinations than landfill - although to a large extent, this has been incineration.\nLandfilled waste by EWC Chapter, England & England and Wales (million tonnes) (Environment Agency, )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the simultaneous effects of other policy instruments, it is difficult to attribute this reduction to the Landfill Tax. A 2023 review of the Landfill Disposal Tax (LDT) in Wales found that increases in recycling since devolution of the tax to Wales in 2017 via the Landfill Disposals Tax (Wales) Act 2017, couldn’t be attributed to the LDT and that other factors including recycling targets had a greater effect on increasing recycling and reuse, while other factors such as zero waste to landfill requirements have been more impactful in driving uptake of alternative technologies.\nSummary of responses to a review of the Landfill Tax commissioned by HMT in 2021 found…\nA key issue with price-based instrument is that without precise information about the aggregate marginal abatement cost curve or the price elasticity of those subject to a tax, the aggregate environmental outcome of a given tax rate can be difficult to predict and necessitate a trial-and-error approach which can delay environmental improvements (Pearce and Barbier, 2000).",

    "section": "Efficiency",
    "text": "Efficiency\nA key proposed benefit of PMBIs is that they can help achieve a particular level of environmental use at the lowest overall cost to society (i.e. are most statically efficient) while providing ongoing incentives to bring down abatement costs over time (Pearce, 2002; Johnson, 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nThe assumed efficiency benefits of PMBIs are attributed to the rationale that if a price is introduced or adjusted to account for environmental impacts, market participants can be incentivised to reduce their environmental use until the cost of abating a further unit of use equals the marginal benefit of reducing that use in terms of avoided tax payments. Across the sector or the economy regulated, this would translate to environmental users with the least abatement costs reducing use more than those facing steeper abatement costs, thereby helping a given level of use be achieved at least cost in line with the equimarginal principle which assumes that societal welfare is maximised when the net present value of marginal abatement benefits equal that of marginal abatement costs (Baumol & Oates, 1971). These cost reductions have been shown in a variety of cases e.g. SO2 trading scheme under the USA Clean Air Act (Goulder, 2013).\nIn addition, it is said that if tax revenue accrued by instruments are used by the government to offset distortionary taxes such as those on labour thereby contributing to change in relative factor prices, it can help further improve market efficiency (Vence and Pérez, 2021). The Ex’tax Project argues that “High taxes on labour encourage businesses to minimise their number of employees. Resources, however, tend to be untaxed; they are used unrestrained. This system causes unemployment, overconsumption and pollution”.\nThe aggregate costs to society (including industry, LAs and the public) of abatement, compliance and administration (Bicket and Salmons, 2013). There has been the following effect on the mining and quarrying sector in the UK, with the following effects on competitiveness… The quarrying of aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock remains the most common type of mineral operation in England ().\nCharge-rebate schemes are cited as having potentially high transaction costs.\nWhere regulation is so stringent all available abatement measures must be taken, market-based instruments aren’t always significantly more cost-effective than standards.\nThe EU has put into practice the trading theory through the ETS through the Emissions Trading Directive, adopted in 2003 and amended in 2009, which applies to large installations throughout Europe and seeks to reduce their GHG emissions by 40% compared to the baseline by 2030. The EU ETS has been seen as a resounding failure due to several issues: 1) Technical - Overall cap being too generous resulting in the price of permits being too low and leaving little incentive for further reduction through the sale of permits 2) Principled - with issues of fairness related to the permit dissemination approach of grandfathering being questioned and 3) Foundation - with the commodification of environmental quality.",

    "text": "Affordability\nThe UK government raises over £820 billion a year in receipts, primarily through The income tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) and value added tax (VAT) which together raise over £470 billion. Environmental taxes make up a relatively small share of this revenue, though nevertheless appear to generate net-revenues for government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nIn theory, PMBIs can generate administrative savings in time and money by devolving management decisions from regulators to private decision makers who are better aware of their own abatement costs (Baumol and Oates, 1971; Stavins, 1998).\nRevenue generating instruments preferred from an affordability perspective than subsidies. Where subsidies are offered, these need to be financed. For example, a €154 million fund announced in 2023 and set up to cover payments to citizens in France, who will be able to claim €7 for mending a heel and €10-€25 for clothing repairs between 2023-2028. Subsidies present a cost to the government which if funded through general taxation can also be economically distortive.\n‘The latest HMRC statistics show that the aggregate levy raised £407m in total receipts in the 2016/17 financial year (a proportion of this has funded the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund managed by Natural England). This has been the largest amount collected.’ Resource-related taxation makes up a relatively small share of total environmental taxes in the UK (ONS, 2023).\nA 2023 FOI revealed that the PPT has generated over 200 million GBP in the first three quarters following its introduction, with ring-fencing of revenues called for (CIWM, 2023).\nGovernment revenue from environmental taxes in the UK, 1997 to 2021 (ONS, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumed benefits of optimal pricing scenarios in rational choice and welfare maximising frameworks imply likely high information requirements for both the MDC and MAC, which leads regulators to general seek acceptable or improved rather than optimal levels (Pearca and Turner, 1990).\nTaxes increase costs of products and activities in a predictable manner, making it easier to judge first round financial impact on consumers and firms (OECD 2011) in comparison to permits, for which the future price can be difficult to predict. Can be difficult to determine the right number of permits to allocate as an underallocation may lead to high costs, and an overallocation can limit the ability to reach a desired level of environmental use. Regulators can use best estimates but carries environmental (e.g. irreversible damage) and economic (e.g. locking firms into technological choices) risks (Hanley et al. 1997).\nOn the flip side, some of these instruments (taxes, charges and auctioned permits) can generate tax revenues which can offset administrative costs, be ringfenced to finance further improvements in a target industry and potentially more distortionary taxes if used for this purpose. Revenue recycliing can play an important role in defining the overall efficiency of PMBIs, including via reducing the cost-ramp of alternative technologies. When people do not trust that a carbon price will be sufficient to reduce emissions, they prefer using the carbon price revenue to subsidise low-carbon technologies and research. The state doesn’t collect as much revenue with markets as taxes, though you can auction permits, and do so annually to increase revenues. Administered markets are generally more resource-consuming than non-market fiscal instruments, and both require monitoring.",

Long-term cost effectiveness of price vs quantity mechanisms are affected by their responsiveness to change. This can vary in three circumstances: 1) In the presence of rapid rates of economic growth, a fixed tax leads to an increase of aggregate emissions whereas permits can give no allowance to this, but the price of permits increases to account for the enhanced desire for them; 2) In the context of inflation, a unit tax decreases in real terms and so emissions levels increases, whereas with a permit system there is no change in the aggregate; and 3) In the presence of exogenous technological change, a tax system leads to increases in control levels and a decrease in aggregate emissions whilst a permit system maintains emissions with a fall in permit prices (Stavins, 2006).\nThough addressing the environmental externality, prices alone may not address the innovation market failures comprehensively as may pull through sub-optimal technologies, thereby necessitating supply-side technology instruments being introduced alongside (Goulder, 2013).",

Callan et al. (2009) found a carbon tax of 20 euros/tCO2 with revenue recycling in Ireland was marginally regressive, though if the tax revenue were used to increase social benefits and tax credits, households across the income distribution would be made better off without exhausting the total carbon tax. Grainger and Kolstad (2009) a Co2 tax would be 4x higher for the lower quintile of US population than upper quintile. However, design is also important. They found this wouldn’t necessarily be the case for a tax such as on gasoline which would be progressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nPMBIs can also create hotspots of concentrated pollution which can disproportionately affect subpopulations, leading to spatially engendered inequity.\nRegressive effects may not be solely restricted to households. Introducing a raw material tax might disproportionately affect those sectors that are not able to easily substitute raw materials for secondary materials. Using the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model, Bibas, Chateau and Lanszi (2021) assessed the global economic and environmental impacts of fiscal reform consisting of taxes on primary metal and mineral resources and the circulation of revenues to finance subsidies to recycled goods and secondary metal production. They found this would deliver a relative decoupling of primary material use from economic growth to 2040, with a reduction of 7% in metallic and non-metallic minerals compared to the baseline scenario alongside negligible effect on global GDP (loss of 0.2% global GDP in 2040). Regional disparities were identified, depends on whether countries were net importers or exporters of raw materials, available production technologies and input costs of primary and secondary materials.\nChateau and Mavroeidi (2020) in the study ‘The jobs potential of a transition towards a resource efficient and circular economy’, examined the consequences of a policy-driven transition towards a more resource-efficient and circular economy on employment levels across countries and sectors between 2018-40 using the structural computable general equilibrium model ENV-Linkages. The reallocation of jobs due to a package of fiscal policies was found to be limited, with net job creation globally positive but marginally, at 1.8 million, with high variability between industries and countries. Countries with large extraction sectors were found to see net-job losses, as was the case in sectors depending heavily on primary materials such as construction and some manufacturing sectors, including production of machinery and electronic equipment. Secondary metals and recyclable sectors benefited from large increases in employment. In a scenario in which only OECD countries implemented these policies, employment losses were expected relative to the baseline due to a relative loss of competitiveness.",

Similarly, the Aggregates Levy has had cross-border effects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland due to the lack of a tax on aggregates or primary materials in Ireland (EEA, 2008), although this was somewhat mitigated by the levy credit scheme (ACLS). A 2021 report by the National Audit Office found that the Landfill Tax might have led to an increase in fly-tipping rates. In Wales, the 2016 post-implementation review of the single-use carrier bag charge found that only 13% of eligible firms reported a negative impact on their business.

The OECD (2022) has explored interactions between deposit-return systems and other extended producer responsibility (EPR) mechanisms, noting some potentially negative interactions highlighted by the industry (Packaging Portal, 2023).

Markets are generally more politically desirable than taxes - with there less fear that government will abuse the system for revenue generation ends, the polluter pays only for the non-optimal portion of total emissions (though not always) and can feel more in control of a permit system (Pearce and Barbier, 2000).\nReductions in the current tax regime such as on VAT, capital allowances and too subsidies are least preferred options by government authorities due to reductions in tax receipts and exchequer costs.",

Altering the WEEE Directive’s current ‘collective producer responsibility’ approach by modulating responsibility according to criteria of good design (as a proxy for end-of-life treatment) might make the tool a more effective driver of eco-design.\n2012 review by the Individual Producer Responsibility Working Group into introduction of individual producer responsibility in the UK recommends: drivers of eco-design are strengthened when individual producers are made directly responsible for total end-of-life costs, however reverse logistics of producers collecting their own waste is viewed as impractical. Therefore modulating fees can be an effective middle-ground.\nWhile administrative data shows that the WEEE Regulations have helped enshrine the polluter pays principle, evidence of the impacts on product design is mixed (Kautto, 2006; Yu, Hills and Welford, 2008). Gottberg et al. (2006) - Used a literature review to develop analytical framework to explain the relationship between drivers for eco-design and the role of policies promoting EPR under the WEEE Directive (2002/96/EC). Applied framework to 8 case studies of firms from the European lighting sector. Though based on little quantitative data, which data they had seemed to suggest EPR had little effect on product development up to then as producers had been able to pass on incremental costs associated with EPR to customers with negligible effects on sales (as demand is relatively inelastic, perhaps given current prices, and given that EPR applies to all producers equally). EPR deemed unlikely to drive eco-design in the short run. Found other policies such as bans on hazardous substances, product declarations and supply chain pressures were often more effective promoters of eco-design and that a mix of policy measures required vs. reliance on economic instruments alone.\nEPR fee modulation is an emerging approach (Laubinger et al. 2021)."

While government plans to alter the WEEE Regulations through modulating fees according to criteria of good design could contribute to making the tool a more effective driver of eco-design, it is unclear at this point if the financial incentives this gives alone will be sufficient to drive the design changes needed for longer lifespans of new products (Milios, 2018; Kunz et al. 2014).

Specific areas of value chain, specific products?\nRegion of introduction - We prioritise evidence collected on instruments which have been applied in the UK due to institutional and contextual specificities of countries making up the UK. We do so through cross-referencing studies against a list of relevant UK policies identified through a search of legislation portal and OECD database.12 We next prioritise evidence from countries with similar PPP.\nOutcomes and impacts - We assess instruments in scope against the following set of criteria or ‘Critical Success Factors’ (CSFs) - in the HM Treasury Green Book as ‘attributes essential to the successful delivery of projects and programmes’ (HM Treasury, 2022). Evidence on the following outcomes and impacts were collated, with effectiveness of particular interest.\n\nEffectiveness - There is often a high level of uncertainty regarding the impacts of policy change, with this based on a range of factors. To assess effectiveness, we capture evidence on the effect of instruments in relation to their objectives, which given the scope of our study includes measures such as reducing (primary) resource use, waste generation, reducing leakage and improving waste treatment and including the immediacy (indicative time required to implement) with which these effects arise and certainty of meeting aims (predictability).\nEfficiency - We also consider evidence on how efficiently outcomes are delivered (value for money) and the role of instruments in moving the UK towards a more optimal distribution of goods, services and pollution (allocative efficiency). We include findings from both cost-effectiveness analysis3 and cost-benefit analysis.4\nFinancial cost to the public sector - A key part of moving from theoretical to actual benefits is political and administrative feasibility (the ability to put a policy into effect in a given context), with government affordability an important parts of this (OECD, 1999). In addition to considering evidence on abatement and compliance costs from the perspective of the regulatee, we look for evidence on direct and indirect administrative costs to government (including at policy design and enforcement stages) of instruments, as well as evidence on revenues generated which can offset these (HMT, 2022).\nLong-run effects - We look for evidence on the long-run effects of instruments and their ability to meet regulatory aims persistently into the future while providing incentives for continued improvements beyond the minimum. This includes their continued effectiveness under a variety of circumstances and resilience to external changes such as inflation, ability to be updated in response to new information and capacity to harness technological change through providing incentives for innovation over time so as to lower the costs of achieving goals over time (Fiorino, 2004).\nDistributional and equity effects - Considering the net-effects of instruments on different people and groups, and how these may exacerbate pre-existing inequities (Bryant and Bailey, 1997). Evidence of regressive effects across income strata, geography concerning any of the groups identified by the Equality Act 2010 as well as disproportionate burdens on small and micro businesses are sought to be captured (RPC, 2019).\nSpillovers - We look for evidence on spillovers, both positive and negative and including: 1) Soft effects such as impacts on attitudes, awareness and learning; 2) Wider economic impacts including on innovation and trade; and 3) Perverse incentives and any contribution to potentially unintended consequences such as negatively impacting competition or giving rise to cross-media impacts.5\nStrategic fit - How policy intervention supports ‘national, regional, local or organisational policies, initiatives and targets’, align with other projects and programmes and fits with wider business strategy of UK public bodies (HM Treasury, 2018).\n\n\nThese inclusion criteria were translated into search terms and entered into the repositories.

    "text": "In the Paleolithic when our Homo genus predecessors lived as scavengers and then hunter-fisher-gatherers, material accumulation was limited as mobility and adaptability to nature were the key traits conducive to survival (Barbier, 2015). At the advent of the Neolithic Revolution (around 10,000 BC), global material use was an estimated 7 million tonnes per year (Mt/yr) (Krausmann, Weisz and Eisenmenger, 2016). This was at a time when the human population was between 6-10 million people, and that of the British Isles is thought to have been as low as 5,000. The Neolithic Revolution in the UK saw what population there was shift from hunting and foraging alone to swidden and then permanent farming practices, with an expansion in cultivated natural capital and foodstuff increasingly an output of joint production of ecosystem and economic production (Jones and Rowley-Conwey, 2007). Biomass was the primary material group relied upon at the time, including for the purposes of heating, clothing and shelter alongside some minimal use of non-metallic minerals such as clay and stone for uses likes tools and utensils.\nThe British Isles has a significant history of metallic mineral extraction stretching back over several thousand years, with a complex geological history giving rise to a diverse range of mineral deposits (Bloodworth, 2014).1 The use of copper in the UK, the earliest metal for which there is evidence of extraction, marked the transition from the Stone to Chalcolithic Age around 2500BC and its alloying with tin brought about the subsequent Bronze Age. The extensive cassiterite deposits in the Southwest of England led to the region to be integrated into the Mediterranean economy early in economic history (Gerrard, 2000). The Iron Age, beginning around 1000BC in the Eastern Mediterranean and moving through Europe in the centuries after, was associated with the growing use of metal for tools to the benefit of agricultural productivity. Food surpluses supported specialization and urbanisation, with increasingly complex and populous societies across the globe evolving into civilizations for whom the most valuable forms of capital were fertile land, natural resources, labour, dwellings, tools and domesticated animals (Barbier, 2015). The earliest available evidence of coinage is from approximately 500BC (in Western Anatolia), and this offered a fungible medium of exchange for trade in surpluses. By around 0AD, the global human population was an estimated 170-400 million people (US Census Bureau, 2022), while that in the British Isles is thought to have reached around 2 million people by then.\nPopulation, GDP and GDP per capita, UK 0AD-2008AD (Maddison, 2008)\nWhile the division of labour, technological innovation and other aspects of cumulative culture  provided the underpinnings for economic growth, between 0AD and 1650, average annual incomes in Britain were estimated to have stayed roughly constant at around £1,000 per capita in today’s prices (Figure 2) (Broadberry et al. 2015; Thomas and Dimsdale, 2017).2 It is thought that around 1550AD, a growing scarcity of firewood in Britain incentivised the increased exploitation of coal, the use of which removed the biomass fund-based energy reliance that had acted as a constraint on the growth of the prior agrarian regime (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971; Fisher-Kowalski and Haberl, 2007). The 1st Industrial Revolution, facilitated by developments in scientific knowledge and trade, enabled by cheap labour and materials and fuelled by coal and the steam engine, took place in the UK from the mid 1700s, bringing with it an increased build-up of man-made or reproducible capital assets which quickly overtook agricultural land as the major component of wealth in the UK and other early-industrialising economies (Barbier, 2015). The invention of coke by Darby in the 1700s reduced the cost of producing steel and in conjunction with the widespread availability of iron, saw British heavy industry grow. With these developments, the material and energy throughput of UK society also increased, with increased production enabling greater consumption.\nBy 1850, material use globally had reached approximately 4 billion tonnes per year (Gt/yr) with this skewed towards the wave of industrialising countries (Krausmann, Weisz and Eisenmenger, 2016). Increases in per capita consumption of fossil fuels and non-metallic minerals at this time were largely additive to that of biomass. During the 18th Century, lead and iron vied for second place behind wool as England’s main export (Barnatt and Penny, 2004). The 2nd Industrial Revolution, occurring from around the 1870s in the UK and powered by electricity, was associated with an expansion in mass production and particular developments in the technologies of illumination, mobility and communication. Management innovations, including Fordist mass production of the 1920s and Demming’s quality movement of the 1950s drove frontier productivity and their diffusion, total output. Happening alongside was a consistent increase in material use, and from an estimated 7Gt/yr of material consumption in 1900 when the global population consisted of roughly 1.6 billion people, humanity’s use of resources worldwide had reached approximately 27 Gt/yr by 1970 (Figure 3) (Krausmann, Weisz and Eisenmenger, 2016).\nGlobal resource use 1900-2017, billion tonnes (Krausmann, Weisz and Eisenmenger, 2016; IRP, 2021)\nThe 3rd Industrial Revolution beginning from the 1950s, has been associated with the rise of digital technologies and the ‘Information Age’, while the 4th Industrial Revolution has seen these technologies applied to an increasing number of areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics and quantum computing. In the UK, economic growth had led to, and resulted from, structural change in the output mix of the domestic economy, with higher value opportunities for labour in information-intensive sector and loss of competitiveness in other sectors, manufacturing in particular. Consumption of outputs from sectors such as manufacturing remain and is generally met by imports. Notwithstanding evidence of relative dematerialization against population and output globally, from the 1970s, the rate of increase in global material consumption has accelerated. Material consumption stood at over 90Gt/yr in 2017 and continues to rise.\nChanges in societal metabolism over the last millennia have not been restricted to scale, marked also by a shift from a reliance on biomass and renewable materials associated with primarily agrarian-based economies and traditional technologies, towards growing quantities of fossil fuels and metallic and non-metallic mineral resource use associated with modern technologies of increasingly industrial and post-industrial societies. Key materials of civilisation today include ammonia, steel, plastic and concrete alongside a massive proliferation of new chemicals for which the environment frequently has limited or no assimilative capacity (Smil, 2022). Relatively inert and homogenous solid waste streams have resultantly been replaced by an increasing array of materials in the UK.\nThe composition of waste from households 1892-2012 (Greenfield and Woodard in Government Office for Science, 2016)\nIn 2020 (± 6 years), anthropogenic material stocks globally, by weight, were estimated to have surpassed all living biomass - partially driven by humanity having roughly halved the mass of plant life since the first Agricultural Revolution (Elhacham et al. 2020). As now the most significant geomorphological driving force on the planet (Cooper et al. 2018), humans and the materials that they extract, harvest and cultivate, move, transform, consume and dispose of are a key driver of the gradual, yet continuous, systemic and accelerating degradation of many of our natural capital assets seen around the world today – with a general trend towards net environmental degradation, biospheric decline and loss of non-provisioning ecosystem services in many places (Goudie and Viles, 1997; Ruddiman, 2003; Dasgupta et al. 2021). This is apparent across indicators including mineral resource depletion, declines in wild fish stocks, the accumulation of persistent toxic chemicals, loss of top soil, build-up of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and species extinction. Today, the planet’s extractive industries are thought to be responsible for at least half of the world’s carbon emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity loss (UNEP, 2019).\nThough there have been positive developments in several areas relating to the use of resources in the UK in recent decades such as a shift away from landfilling of local authority collected waste, many indicators point to a continued high degree of linearity in the economy, unsustainable levels of resource consumption and natural capital loss and depletion. In 2021, the mass of materials directly entering the UK economy to meet domestic demand stood at around 500 million tonnes (ONS, 2023a), while when accounting for the full upstream material extraction along international supply chains to satisfy domestic final demand, the UK’s material footprint in 2020 was only slightly short of 1 billion tonnes or 14 tonnes per capita (ONS, 2023b). Per capita raw material consumption in the UK remains significantly higher than the global average and many times greater than the average levels of material use seen in low-income countries - where footprints can be as small as 1 t/yr. In 2018 (the latest year for which data are available), over 220 million tonnes of total waste were estimated to have been generated in the UK, almost 10% more than in 2010 (Defra, 2023a). An estimated 60 million tonnes of this came from construction and demolition activities (Defra, 2023a), 10 million tonnes came in the form of food waste (WRAP, 2022) and 2 million tonnes, textiles (WRAP, 2019). Of the waste generated in the UK, a significant quantity continues to be lost from the economy each year, with roughly a third entering landfills or incineration and an appreciate amount entering the natural environment via fly-tipping and littering (Defra, 2023a; Defra, 2023c; KBT, 2020).\nWhile it remains difficult to say what a sustainable rate of resource use might be at the global level today, many signs point towards current levels already being too high and contributing to humanity overstepping multiple planetary boundaries (Bleischwitz, 2010; Richardson et al. 2023).3 Assuming current systems of production and consumption remain unchanged furthermore, it is estimated that the extraction of materials to meet the anticipated demands of a global population in 2060 of around 10 billion people could rise to more than double current levels or approximately 160 Gt/yr (OECD, 2019). Notwithstanding the significant uncertainty associated with such estimates, Dittrich et al. (2012), point to a sustainable level of global material extraction likely not exceeding 50Gt/yr - a level echoed by Hoekstra and Wiedmann (2014) (O’Neill et al. 2018). On a per capita basis, this would equate to a global limit of 8 tonnes per year by 2030, broadly reflecting a level recommended to target by UNEPs IRP (2011) of between 6 and 8 tonnes per year by 2050 (in Bringezu, 2015)."

Previously a downside with price-based instruments was the lack of certainty, undermining the use of MBIs, though quantity-based instruments now provide the same assurance. Familiarity stems from regulators and regulates knowing what is required and what outcomes are likely to be Technology and performance standards will be more predictable than price-based instruments in a context of uncertainty over abatement costs (Bergquist et al. 2013). In a context of inflation, technology and performance standards can also more robustly generate environmental impact than price-based instruments without the need for updates (Bye and Klemetsen, 2016).; 2) immediacy -  argued that by imposing fixed standards with the force of law behind them, CAC can respond more quickly to activities which do not abide by the set standards (Baldwin, Cave and Lodge, 2011) though timeliness may be offset by resistance from regulatory targets and hasn’t been seen by some researchers e.g. Harrington (Perman, 2011) Regulatory approaches have also been often preferred for their ability to deliver desired outcomes quickly (following point of regulatory introduction). In phasing out leaded gasoline in Europe for instance, progress would have been slowed without mandating the use of catalytic converters and maximum lead content in fuel, as well as tax differentials. At the same time, Stricter standards create incentive for polluters to seek relief from authorities by delaying their application date.; and 3) familiarity and political willingness - Can be more palatable for industry because total costs from C&C can be lower than taxes for instance as price up to the efficient level doesn’t have to be paid.\nC&C seen early on as way to achieve desired outcomes quickly.

Evidence for swiftness being better under C&C than MBIs is mixed, with evidence supporting C&C e.g. the phase out of TCE by the EPA, with limits proving effect, while MBIs in other contexts e.g. effluent fees on organic waste-loads in Netherlands produced swift results.\nAs regulations often need to be highly specific in their terminology, this can limit their impacts to specified sectors (Anderson et al. 2011).",

For instance, Jaffe and Stavins (1994) suggest that technology standards may give poor incentives for technical or managerial innovation as there is no financial incentive to go beyond the standard, and there may even be a non-compliance penalty to doing so (van den Bergh, 2011; Requate, 2005). Performance standards perform better, particularly if compliance charges can be lessened through innovation.\nHowever, Begquist et al. (2013) find C&C can be flexible and effective when well implemented inc. with dynamic efficiency benefits in the form of innovation, though they are generally less statically efficient than MBIs.\nCostly regulation generally does provide a spur to find less costly ways of complying generally but technology standards can discourage research.\nMeasuring persistent environmental performance in terms of emission intensity across range of pollutants in Norway using panel data, find positive and significant effects of non-tradable emission quotas and technology standards much like with taxes. However, the persistence of effects come as standard with C&C while taxes need to be continually increased (Bye and Klemetsen, 2016). Even if a quota is fixed, non-tradable quotas can create an incentive for a firm to reach this level at the lowest cost by reorganize the production process or investing in new technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nWeiss and Anisimova (2018) found Swedish environmental regulation aimed at pulp & paper mills based on flexible prescriptive regulation e.g. the use of extended compliance periods induced long-term process-based innovation offsets to compliance costs.

Policies of potential relevance to the CE can therefore be separated into different domains of focus and particularly whether they are levied on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial flows and stocks in and at the interface of the economy\n\n\n\n\n\nThese consist of - policies levied on material flows and stocks (built capital) within the economy such as mandated recycling rates or secondary material requirements as well as more widely relating to the quality, quantity and location of materials, components or products; and - policies applied at the technosphere-ecosphere boundary such as relating to the use of the environment as a material source or sink e.g. the UK Landfill Tax or UK Aggregates Levy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWider effluents\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as being relevant to CE objectives through contributing to the same long-term outcomes sought, instruments directly regulating emissions to the environment (atmosphere, land and water) can indirectly leverage CE value drivers. For instance, some evidence suggests fuel economy standards introduced primarily to reduce fuel use have been met partly through the lightweighting of vehicles (IRP,2020). At the same time, other evidence points to fuel economy standards potentially encouraging a shift towards larger size vehicles in some markets (Whitefoot and Skerlos, 2011), while policies such as increasing the turnover of capital stocks via scrappage schemes to reduce the emissions intensity of the in-use stock, can appear to run directly counter to CE value drivers in the immediate term and the impacts of these should be considered and managed as best as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe natural capital stock\n\n\n\n\n\nInstruments regulating the condition and/or processes of the natural capital stock such as targets on tree cover or microplastic pollution levels, can also be relevant to the CE outcomes and principles outlined through routes such as increasing the supply of sustainable feedstocks or indirectly incentivizing reductions in the environmental intensity of economic activities through limits on the use of the environment as a source or sink.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial, human and social capital and transfers\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ellen MacArthur Foundation outline strategic-level policy goals ‘to develop, deploy and scale circular economy solutions’ (EMF, 2021) and which include: make the economics work; invest in innovation, infrastructure and skills e.g. investing in domestic reprocessing capacity (HM Government, 2023); and collaborate for systems change. Reflected here is the importance of investing in human capital and innovation for a CE transition – including education and specific knowledge, enabling development processes such as retraining as well as the availability and alignment of other inputs such as finance. Institutional and social capital, including networks, norms and trust can also help lower transaction costs in a CE transition and support the innovation process (alongside project-level support) across stages from invention to niche market creation, diffusion and saturation (Maskell, 2000). Macroeconomic policy can also be highly relevant through its effect on the scale of economic activities and resultant material and energy throughput (Sterner and Corsia, 2013).\n\n\n\nOther policy domains of indirect relevance to CE objectives, include those relating to human health e.g. the UK ban on asbestos which can make reduce risks and barriers to construction waste recovery activities.",

    "text": "Policy rationale - tackling barriers and failures\nBarriers are things that restrain change towards a particular outcome and can represent elements of the status quo which if not managed, can delay or limit change, in some cases indefinitely (OECD, 2009). Barriers to CE implementation can arise in many forms across economic, policy, technological, social and operational dimensions and which can differ by product or value chain stage. Introducing regulation without consideration of these can lead to deadweight loss.\nAs an example, barriers to the expansion of domestic recycling capacity have been noted to include relatively lower prices for exporting waste (which is treated as equivalent to domestic reprocessing in current regulatory frameworks), the volatility of recycling note values in existing packaging recycling note markets and resultant uncertain returns on investments (Iacovidou et al. 2020 in OECD, 2022). Further examples of barriers along the value chain are outlined in the figure below.\n\nExamples of barriers along the value chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe grounds for introducing policy is sometimes thought about in terms of responding to particular ‘failures’ described further below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Market failures\n\n\n\n\n\nTheoretically, a market failure is a problem that violates one of the assumptions of the first theorem of welfare economics (that a private market economy will achieve efficiency) and causes the market economy to deliver an outcome that does not maximize efficiency. The conditions required to maximize market efficiency include, among others, full information as well as the absence of externalities and split incentives (van Ewijk, 2018). At the level of the economy as a whole, ‘market failures’ that inhibit an increase in resource efficiency, resource productivity and a more circular economy include (van Ewijk, 2018):\n\nExternalities - As well as eating into natural capital stocks when use rates exceed those of renewal, processes of extraction, production and disposal can often also negatively impact the environment via pollution and land use change. These impacts are frequently unmarketed, with externalities referring to uncompensated costs or benefits not accounted for in production/consumption functions. Correcting these frequently requires the involvement of government to reduce the oversupply of negative externalities or enhance the undersupply of positive externalities. Price and market-based instruments work by reflecting externalised environmental costs within market prices or by creating property rights over the environment and facilitating exchange of these;\nMissing markets or excessive market frictions - An absence of markets can lead to missing economic incentives for activities that can reduce externalities such as using secondary materials. Regulation can encourage these markets to develop such as secondary material requirements or reduced market frictions through providing data platforms for industrial symbiosis e.g. N. Ireland’s resource matchmaking scheme;\nSplit incentives - Split incentives refer to instances where an actor in the position of being able to make a decision which might improve the treatment of resources does not stand to gain even though others may, and thereby leading to limit incentives to make changes (Ekins et al. 2019),. Examples of this are manufacturers not being incentivised to design products for more circular end of life treatment as they do not shoulder the costs of waste disposal nor stand to gain from recovered resources under most management regimes. Policy levers which can help correct this include market-ordering instruments such as EPR, though design is an important consideration. Market-ordering instruments such as EPR work by aligning the incentives of actors to ensure they are responsible for and benefit from, environmentally-relevant decisions; and\nInformation failures - More circular systems frequently require new or improved information exchange between actors. A wide range of data-gaps nevertheless exist relevant to the circular economy and in particular, information asymmetries can exist between producers and consumers regarding product characteristics such as for durability or ease of repair. These can be viewed as a failure in information markets. Information-based instruments, including programmes of guidance for SMEs, developing data systems and disclosure requirements can be used to resolve information undersupply and asymmetries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n System failures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK is one of the most technologically innovative countries in the world, supported by conducive physical and technological infrastructure, scientific and technological capabilities and high levels of human capital alongside strong education and training, the availability of risk capital and wider social contextual factors (Storper, 1997). An ‘innovation-systems’ perspective emphasises the role of regulation in tackling factors inhibiting innovation and which can indirectly hinder CE outcomes (van Ewijk, 2018). These partly overlap with market failures (e.g., positive knowledge externalities), but also include an absence of relevant infrastructure and institutions (Maskell, 2000), low levels of human capital and limited access to required resource.\nGovernment bodies can support innovation processes via laws and regulation. This includes through technology-push policies stimulating the supply of new technologies, demand-pull policies to increase the size of a market for new technologies and environmental policies, to support technologies the emergence or expansion of which may be undermined by market failures (Sandén and Azar, 2005). Government, and too other actors, can also support innovation through enabling interactions via the development of stakeholder discussion platforms to support constructive collaboration and competition. The use of waste as resources, for example, depends on mutual trust between entrepreneurs as well as effective standards. To tackle these failures, government can also build capabilities through the provision of education, funds and collaborative platforms to build knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Transition failures\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile addressing market failures is often a primary objective in UK regulation, even well-functioning markets in terms of being allocatively efficient can be blind to long-term societal goals (van Ewijk, 2018). To promote sustainable consumption, production and investment, some degree of institutional planning initiated by a community or government can also be necessary (van Ewijk, 2018; Weber and Rohracher, 2012). In many cases furthermore, major societal breakthroughs have been achieved through concerted government effort to drive long-term change, including dedicated research funding and infrastructural development (Mazzucato, 2015). The government plays an important role in driving the direction of long-term societal change that meets the needs of the whole populace as part of public interest regulation. Therefore, transitioning to more resource productive systems of production and consumption can be undermined by ‘transition failures’, such as insufficient guidance and coordination being in place for driving a system towards intended outcomes.\nPolicy instruments to resolve transition failures include target setting which can offer strategic direction to engender focused action. Another set of policy intervention relates to the coordination of sectors to ensure coherence in actions. Coordination and ensuring policy coherence across sectors and time can be done through aligning policies across sectors and materials, such as between requirements for recycled content and the sufficient provision of waste infrastructure to collect recyclables. Innovation policies can also be key to overcome existing technological equilibria where no individual actor has sufficiently strong incentive or capacity to make change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Amending government failures\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment or regulatory failure can occur through two forms. Firstly, where state actors have failed to intervene where doing so could have otherwise realistically promoted greater efficiency. This can be understood as regulatory failure of the first type. Secondly, previous government intervention may have led to a less efficient situation than before or what might have otherwise realistically been due e.g. to poor policy design, the costs of interventions being higher than benefits or missing information. This can be thought of as government failure of the second type. The types of issues arising through government failure can span all other failures outlined here. For instance, predominant models of producer responsibility in the UK have been based on ‘collective responsibility’, with the costs for the collection and recycling shared among participating companies based on the amount of products put on the market. This approach lowers the ambition of individual companies to develop more circular products as a company would have to bear the costs of improved design and production changes while the benefits of the reduced end-of-life costs would be shared with all other companies in the market i.e. there is a split incentive as a result (van Rossem et al. 2006). Tackling historic government failures can therefore be an important part of a CE policy pathway.",

For instance, while certain instruments such as taxes might help reach near-term objectives, technology-push policies might need to be introduced concurrently to bring new technologies to the shelf without which more ambitious long-term objectives may not easily be met (Sandén and Azar, 2005).\nDifferent schools of thought exist on best sequencing approaches. Bleischwitz (2010) calls for a step-by-step approach to policy introduction addressing market failures first. ‘Smart regulation principles’ recommend a responsive approach, whereby instrument choice is escalated from combinations including least interventionist approaches to those which involve a higher degree of coercion based on responsiveness of regulatees (Gunningham, 2009). Marginal abatement cost-curve (MACC) approaches propose starting with policies with least net cost and expanding out. Criticisms of MACC-based approaches relate primarily to overlooking temporal interdependence between policies, however. For instance, Grubb and Wieners (2020) illustrate a slow carbon price ramp approach is likely inefficient in the case when carbon abatement costs are shaped by innovation.  In this case, higher cost options may be more effective to start with if they drive down innovation over time, and therefore reduce cumulative costs.",
