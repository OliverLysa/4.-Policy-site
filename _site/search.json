    "text": "Measures\nRealising a more circular UK economy will require and involve changes in production and consumption practices across the economy, including at the level of products and production processes, wider infrastructure and business and consumption models. On the production side, these include substituting (often imported) material inputs for labour and capital via, for instance, greater domestic remanufacturing as well as primary for secondary materials, where used. On the consumption side, they include moving towards service-based consumption and keeping products in use for their technical lifespan (OECD, 2022).3\nThese changes can be referred to as measures, which will carry private and public costs and benefits and be associated with risks and opportunities. In addition, the choice of policy instrument(s) applied in an attempt to bring these changes about, are already and will also continue to have, an important role in defining the cost and benefits of these pathways. The five centres making up the NICER programme covering resource flows including textiles, construction minerals, steel, chemicals and technology metals, have identified a range of measures across value chain stages needed to unlock the benefits of a more circular economy in the UK.\nFor the Interdisciplinary Circular Economy Centre for Mineral-based Construction Materials (ICEC-MCM), these include:\n\nAltered product design, including the rationalisation of materials and improved disassembly;\nGreater capacity in production processes for using secondary materials e.g. electric-arc furnaces for steel;\nChanges in purchasing decisions towards products that are more durable;\nIncreased repair and reuse;\nGreater certification of used goods; and\nMore consistent waste collection.\n\nFor the Interdisciplinary Centre for Circular Metals (CircularMetal), these include:\n\nEAF steel production to be more affordable;\nThe use of more generic aluminium and steel alloys;\nPurchases based on durability and life-cycle costs;\nChanges in ownership models to enable refurbishment and reuse;\nImproved valuation of used parts;\nNew melt processing techniques; and\nNew scrap sorting and recycling technologies.\n\nFor the Textiles Circularity Centre (TCC), these include:\n\nAdditive manufacturing for the fabrication and finishing of textiles; and\nChemical recycling.\n\nFor the National Interdisciplinary Centre for the Circular Chemical Economy (CircularChem),  these include:\n\nElectrochemical conversion of CO2 to olefins"

    "text": "Value drivers\nThese measures can be grouped into several broad strategies or value drivers (Hirsch and Schempp, 2020) which in line with a systems-based approach, need to be applied in combination to achieve large scale CE transformation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Circular design and production strategies\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on altering existing products or the development of new products to support circular and resource efficient usage. This can be through: design and production and process technologies enabling circular economy strategies further down the value chain; the development and sustainable production of new materials (including bio-based) that are reusable, recyclable or compostable; substantial reductions in substances of concern; the substitution of virgin materials with secondary raw materials and by-products; and reduced material intake through yield loss reduction (including possible substitution) at the process level and lightweighting4 or doing away with unnecessary inputs altogether.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Circular and optimal use models\n\n\n\n\n\nAim to increase the value and use of a product during its (extended) lifetime, including through use intensification. These business and consumption models revolve around enhanced durability: realising technical lifespans; reuse, repair, refurbishment, repurposing and remanufacturing products, their components and assets otherwise discarded; product-to-service, reuse and sharing models based on, inter alia, leasing, pay-per-use, subscription or deposit return schemes; and rehabilitation of degraded land to return to useful state and remediation of abandoned or underutilized brownfield sites in preparation for redevelopment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Circular value recovery models\n\n\n\n\n\nFocus on intercepting legacy resource flows and maximising the recovery and recycling of materials from these after use into new products or useful resources in order to reduce waste. This includes through the development of new reverse logistics to return the products from the point of consumption to the point of production is of huge importance in the category; separate collection and reverse logistics of wastes as well as redundant products, parts and materials enabling circular value retention and recovery strategies; recovery and valorisation of materials from waste (including biomass) and recycling of wastewater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Circular support models\n\n\n\n\n\nCircular support models that focus on the management and coordination of networks, resources such as tools, applications and which incentivise circularity and other supporting activities. They can also support the provision of enabling technologies that facilitate circular business models.\nAligned and extending the strategies for CE value creation, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation outline strategic-level policy goals ‘to develop, deploy and scale circular economy solutions’ (EMF, 2021) which include:\n\nMake the economics work;\nInvest in innovation, infrastructure and skills e.g. investing in domestic reprocessing capacity (Green Finance Strategy, BEIS, 2023); and\nCollaborate for systems change.\n\n\n\n\nInstruments making up the policy toolkit can be used to achieve short-to-medium policy objectives aligned to these value drivers, which, in turn, can help achieve overarching goals. For example, mandatory resource efficiency standards might be used to remove the worst performing products from the market or drive improvements in input efficiency, labels can be used to enable improved consumer purchasing decisions and bans or taxes might be used to discourage most problematic end-of-life treatment options. Furthermore, instruments can differ in their effectiveness and efficiency in achieving these medium and long-term policy objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking policy to value drivers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of policies at the production/product design stage include ecodesign requirements around design (for e.g. durability, repairability, recyclability) or embodied carbon content standards.\nPolicies at the consumption phase include purchasing requirements for public procurement related to resource efficiency criteria and labelling.\nEnd of life instruments include targets on reuse and recycling, EPR, investment in recycling and bans or restrictions on certain waste treatments (Milios, 2021)."

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nWhile investment costs, opportunity costs and uncertain payoffs (Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler 2016) need to be accounted for, several macroeconomic analyses of circular economy transitions have also pointed to positive impacts on macroeconomic outcomes such as GDP and total employment (McCarthy, Dellink and Bibas, 2018; EMF, 2015; Cambridge Econometrics, 2021), though highlighting re-allocation effects across sectors.↩︎\nInnovation can be defined as change leading to new dimensions of performance. It involves the transformation of inventions into usable innovations through processes of learning and practice (Drucker, 2014), that emerge most organically as new combinations of technologies and ways of doing things become more economically viable or accepted than those of old (Schumpeter, 1934). This process acts to ’incessantly revolutionise the economic structure from within (Schumpeter, 1942). Innovation can happen at the level of products through the introduction of a new product or quality of product, through the introduction of new methods or processes, the opening of new markets, result from new sources of supply through input innovation and also occur across social and institutional domains (Jordan, Lemke and Liedtke, 2014).Multiple shifts in technology can be seen in the long-term historic record of humanity and which have impacted the scale and composition of resources used and waste generated. In the Neolithic period, biomass was the primary material group relied upon, including for the purposes of heating, clothing, shelter and utensils. Some 12,000 years later, the materials of modern civilisation include ammonia, steel and concrete, alongside a massive proliferation of new chemicals for which the environment frequently has limited or no assimilative capacity.↩︎\nA range of approaches have been proposed in the literature relating to the UK-specifically and more widely. A 2009 study by WRAP and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) examined the potential of 14 resource efficiency strategies applied in the UK, 7 of which focused on the production-side and 6 of which, consumption, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Production strategies included: lean production (e.g. lightweighting and reduced production process losses); material substitution; reduction of waste and increased recycling; dematerialization of the service sector; sustainable building; and the efficient use of existing infrastructure. Consumption strategies included: lifetime optimization (using goods for their technical lifetime); goods to services (e.g. renting instead of buying products); reducing food waste; dietary change; the expansion of a more restorative economy (e.g. reuse and refurbishment) and public sector procurement. In an update to this study, Norman et al. (2021) outlined eight resource efficiency and resource sufficiency strategies with the potential to reduce UK territorial and overseas emissions associated with material consumption. These strategies include: 1) reducing food waste, as well as the overconsumption of food and carbon intensity of diets; 2) moving from goods to services for certain products; 3) making better use of existing products through lifetime extension; 4) lightweighting products; 5) increasing recycled content; and 6) substituting high-carbon materials for those low-carbon. Hertwick et al. (2019) in a study of material efficiency strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with buildings, vehicles, and electronics, identified a range of broad resource efficiency measures including: 1) increasing the intensiveness of product use i.e. using less material to provide the same service e.g. via increased space-efficient design of buildings or increasing product utilisation rates; 2) lifetime extension (including through repair, resale and remanufacture); 3) lightweight design; 4) reuse of components including through remanufacturing and modularity; 5) recycling, upcycling and cascading; 6) improved production yields and substitution of primary for secondary raw materials as well as substitution across material types. A 2021 United Nations Environment Programme report examined the potential of: 1) material substitution; 2) light-weighting; 3) Increasing intensity of use; 4) lifetime extension; and 5) reuse and recycling, in residential buildings and light weight vehicles for reducing emissions. The Climate Change Committee in an assessment of the role of resource efficiency in achieving the 6th carbon budget, categorised resource efficiency measures into the following groups: design optimisation to reduce material inputs (3 MtCO2e per year in 2035), increased recycling and reuse (3 MtCO2e, of which half is through reuse of construction materials), increasing product longevity (2 MtCO2e, largely from electronics), and increased product utilisation and sharing (1 MtCO2e, including sharing leisure equipment and car clubs).↩︎\nReduce the amount of materials (primary and secondary) consumed along a manufacturing activity.↩︎\nA 2022 OECD review of UK CE policy recommend: “Continue development of a UK product design strategy that supports circular economy goals. This could draw on current work in the European Union and other OECD economies for product standards on durability, reuse, repair and recyclability, together with co-ordination with other advanced economies, including via OECD working parties.”↩︎"

    "text": "Moving towards a more circular economy in the UK presents new data needs, challenges and opportunities. These exist from micro-level interactions in purchasing and capital allocation decisions to the macro-level as an input into opportunity scanning and setting direction with central government policies. Across these needs, high quality, reliable, relevant and timely data are frequently sought. Being in the centre of information and knowledge networks as well as having the ability to regulate hierarchically means central and local government actors can have a key role in filling many data gaps (Hood, 1983; Duit, 2019).\nInformation-based policy instruments seek to create boundary conditions to smoothe socio-technical transitions by influencing knowledge, resolving information-market failures and equipping quasi-regulators (Circle Economy, ). Information-based approaches are diverse covering different directions of flows between actors and include: mandating information disclosure with this information then presented on labels or in registers in any attempt to resolve information asymmetries between actors; the provision of guidance to resolve information gaps; and the regulation of environmental ‘claims’ such as made in advertising regarding the performance of products and organisations.\nOverall, information-based instruments are an important part of a circular-economy policy framework, though their effects alone are likely to be small."

    "text": "Effectiveness and efficiency\n\nEffectiveness\nInformational strategies have long been central to attempts to promote pro-environmental behaviour, however while some studies have found environmental knowledge plays a role in pro-environmental behaviours (e.g. Bartkus et al. 1999), others have found environmental knowledge to have no effect (e.g. Pedersen and Neegaard 2006). Knowledge-action and value-action gaps have been identified in the literature and describe disparities between individual’s knowledge for the environment and their behaviour, which can importantly be influenced by economics (e.g. prices of green options being too high) in addition to other psychological and sociological factors.\nInformation-based approaches can also take time to have an impact (NAO, 2014) and it can be difficult to anticipate how people will react to new information.\nThe effectiveness of informational approaches depend on the quality and type of information reported, its relevance to the intended audience and the resulting capacity to change business behaviour (Sunstein, 1999).\nThe potential impact of information-based instruments will depend on the type of information and its salience, while it will be parameterized by how embedded that information becomes in the decision-making processes of users and disclosers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n2019 Eurobarometer survey covering EU energy label, confirmed that 93% of the population recognised the energy labels, and that 79% of Europeans had been influenced by the label when purchasing an appliance.\nGenerally good evidence they have driven change in the EU’s energy efficiency of labelled products when used in unison with standards.\nSQW Consultancy (2007) concluded eco-labelling and minimum energy performance standards have been effective in increasing energy efficiency in household appliances in the EU, but that labelling alone would not have been effective.\nEuropean Commission (2018) – Evidence from literature reviews, stakeholder intervals, focus groups and experiments showed improved information at the point of purchase was effective at promoting circular economy behaviours. Nudges informing consumers of benefits and norms of buying durable/reparable products increased salience of CE characteristics and triggered shifts in preferences towards more durable/reparable products. When durability or reparability info was provided in experiments, consumers were almost 3 times more likely to choose products with the highest durability on offer, and more than two times more likely to choose products with the highest reparability ratings. Depending on how durability/reparability information was presented, willingness-to-pay for an additional year of durability ranged between 20-36 euros for vacuum cleaners and dishwashers, 92-148 for TVs and 148-217 for smartphones. Improved reparability ratings were around 29-54 euros for vacuum cleaners, 83-105 for dishwashers, 77-171 for TVs and 48-98 for smartphones.\nA 2016 study commissioned by the European Economic and Social Committee used a stated choice experiment in a simulated online retail platform to assess the influence of lifespan labelling on consumer purchasing choices for 9 product categories in four regions under different price scenarios. All types of labels examined were found to affect stated purchase decisions, and on average, sales of long-lived products increased by 14% relative to shorter lived products in the same class. All product groups with exception to televisions were affected, varying from sales of longer-lived products increasing by 24% for suitcases to 11% for smartphones, influenced by the expected replacement rate of these different products. The anomaly for televisions was explained by limited variation across the products proposed.\nEuropean Economic and Social Committee (2016) - An experimental study on the influence of Lifespan Labelling on Consumers with a sample of 2,917 participants across four different European regions (France, Spain, Czech Republic, and Benelux)  and using a dummy retail website to test the effects of lifespan labelling across nine product categories (including suitcases, printers, coffee makers, vacuum cleaners, smartphones, televisions and wash machines) and 10 variations of each, found lifespan labelling had an influence on purchasing decisions in favour of products with longer lifespans. On average, sales of products with a label showing a longer lifespan than competing products increased by 13.8%. Though a significant influence was evident for eight of nine product categories tested, this effect was not uniform across the products purchased, with simulated purchase of televisions not significantly affected by environmental labelling. Suitcases and printers were the products for which labelling had the greatest effect, while smartphones and televisions saw the weakest impact (+11.4%). 90% of respondents were happy to pay more for a similar product with a lifespan that was 2 years longer. On average were willing pay to 102 Euros for this assurance for a dishwasher priced between EUR 300 and EUR 500. Out of four labels tested: 1) a label showing useful lifespans in terms of cycles, page yield; 2) a label showing lifespan in years or months; 3) a label showing cost per year; and 4) a label similar to the energy label, with a scale from A to G. The labels appearing to be particularly effective were 4 (+20.4%) and 2 (+14.1%). Issues with the study are that samples haven’t been based on quotas, and the experimental approach involved limiting the variable to durability labels, while holding constant all else. Thus hasn’t allowed for trading off with other attributes outside of price.\nErskine and Collins (1997) - Little evidence had been seen in the effectiveness of European Commission eco-labels for paper products put in place in 1992.\nGaspar and Antunes (2011) – Research across several EU nations found energy efficiency was the fourth most important attribute after cost, quality and the price-quality tradeoff. Thus, while eco-labels provide desired information, such information is still less important than more traditional product attributes.\nKerret and Gray (2007) - Difficult to measure effectiveness of PRTRs in the Anglo-countries for Industry chemicals absolutely, but can assess relatively between these countries that there is substantial variance in systems across countries and that the presence of a PRTR does not automatically lead to reduce emissions. The focus on risks across these are not necessarily correlated to emissions. Found that US and English system saw consistent reductions in chemicals released into the atmosphere, Canada saw a mix and Australia a rise after PRTR instituted - variable effect. Response strongest in US.\nMatisoff (2013) finds neither state disclosure programmes or the Carbon Disclosure Project (form of civil regulation) in the USA has had a positive impact on carbon intensity or carbon emissions. Considers there may still be a role for ID in conjunction with other policy tools.\nWRAP (2019) - The influence of environmental information may be product dependent. For instance, while a lifespan label influenced choices of washing machines and coffee makers, it did not influence choice of televisions (Jahnich et al. 2016). The addition of running costs to the EU Energy Label was not more effective than just the energy label for vacuum cleaners, fridge freezers or washing machines, but more effective for tumble-dryers (Kalkbekken et al. 2013) and washer-dryers (DECC, 2014).\nA 2023 study by Kantar examining 107 pieces of evidence concluded there is limited evidence of ecolabels greatly influencing consumer and business behaviour, though what data there is shows a small but positive effect (Kantar, 2023).\nAn example in Germany is expanding resource efficiency advice for businesses under the ProgRess programme and contracted out to VDI ZRE - whose product included sector-specific aids, methodologies and information such as resource efficiency checks and process systematisation tools to assist manufacturing enterprises with internal resource efficiency improvement projects. One objective of ProgRess I was the expansion of resource efficiency advice for businesses. Since 2009, with National Climate Initiative funding, BMU/BMUB has contracted out the activities of a Competence Centre for Resource Efficiency. The contract was awarded in 2009, 2012 and 2015 (up to 31 May 2019) to VDI ZRE.\n\n\n\n\n\nCost-effectiveness and efficiency\nEnergy eco-labelling introduced in Europe in 1995 covering 14 domestic and commercial product categories. Goal has been to promote products with better environmental performance on a voluntary basis. Recognized as a (cost) effective policy in driving energy efficiency (TopTen International Services, 2012) in conjunction with ecodesign, in particular."

When eco-design performance requirements were introduced in 1999 in the EU, this weakened consumer comprehension of labels as, for instance, now the worst refrigerators were rated A+ rather than G. Resolved by adding categories first and then scheme rescaled later. The need for rescaling should be anticipated to ensure salience and also to increase their innovatory effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nBawden and Robinson (2008) - Need to ensure information is understandable. An issue highlighted is one of overload, where the information is too much for an individual and it is discarded. There is a real risk of this being the case by adding both an energy efficiency and material efficiency scale (already confusion highlighted in surveys – Waechter et al. 2015).\nWaide et al. (2013) - Assessment of new EU energy labels found the new scale, use of colour, efficiency classification and energy consumption information all assisted comprehension. Room for public education about interpreting the labels however. Better to rescale existing classes than to add new classes as was done in the EU.\nEuropean Environmental Bureau (2015): If a comparative label is adopted, it could be graded on a sliding scale of durability, reparability or lifecycle resource use and an appropriate rating scale is therefore needed. Have to think carefully about what data we want the label to include. Criteria for a comparative label might include: 1) reparability (e.g. availability of spare parts, repair tools and information for repairs); 2) expected product lifespans or the lifespan of key components, the length of product guarantees; 3) upgradability of parts, model, version and brand compatibility; 4) existence of hazardous substances e.g. polybrominated biphenyls in circuit boards; 5) material use i.e. the quantity of materials required for the product. Alternatively, could be presented as an expected product lifespan alone (elicited from firms who are then required to offer a warranty for that period) or annual cost given this expected lifetime (helps standardize).\nJRC (2016) - In a study of material efficiency measures, highlighted it is desirable that EU Ecolabel criteria and Ecodesign requirements are built upon technical analyses of the same features as well and designed as complementary tools to ensure the consistency of diverse policy objectives.\nIdentified ‘hot spots’ or features and characteristics of products that could be improved to facilitate repair, reuse and recycling e.g. the design of battery packs for laptops or for electronic displays, the accessibility to components. Assessing products based on these hot spots could produce a material efficiency score. e.g. the Blue Angle criteria for computer batteries: 1) for life cycle extension focus on whether rechargeable batteries are available for a period of five years from the end of production; 2) for design for recyclability – batteries should be easy to disassemble; 3) for end of life management – information should be provided that batteries should not be disposed of with normal household waste.\nLangley et al. (2012) – In a comparison of the effectiveness of different environmental sustainability information in choice experiments and experimental auctions, found the WTP for washing machines with Energy Labels that had additional carbon footprint data was higher than for machines with an EU Energy Label capturing other impacts. Found adding just one other element of information more effective than several.\nNewell and Siikamaki (2013) found through a choice experiment with alternative labels, that energy efficiency labels were more effective in altering consumer choice when emphasizing cost savings versus physical energy use or carbon emissions. Nevertheless, other analysis e.g. that commissioned by WRAP (2019) on the effectiveness of providing information in encouraging sustainable purchase decisions arrived at the opposite conclusion, finding that although there was robust evidence that energy consumption information can influence purchase behaviour (particularly for the EU Energy Label but varying with other labels and primarily in experimental studies vs. revealed preferences), there was more contested evidence that information on monetary running costs had a positive impact on purchasing decisions."

The regulatory basis for this is in place in the UK already. Under the Consumer Rights Act 2015, consumers are entitled to a right to repair or replacement for defective electronics within 6 years of purchase in England and Wales and 5 years in Scotland. At present however, a retailer has the choice of which remedy between these to provide while after 6 months, the burden of proof of a defect being there at the time of purchase lies with consumers. Changes in these two aspects could help strengthen this tool in extending the lifespan of products within scope.1\nSome evidence of demand for reparability, but people would prefer products that work."

On the other hand, their effectiveness can be limited by encouraging behaviour change in only the regulated sector, can be inefficient through imposing abatement requirements non-equimarginally, and can provide few incentives for innovation beyond meeting standards."

For instance, the Ecodesign Directive has been one of the most effective tools at the level of the EU for delivering per-product energy efficiency improvements and more effective than labels (Schiellerup, 2002 ; Ecofys 2012).\n• The EU Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC) which applies ecodesign requirements to approximately 40 energy-using and energy-related product categories, have primarily focused on energy efficiency in the past. It has been shown to be a highly effective tool for delivering cost-effective energy savings across the EU. In a 2002 study, Schiellerup found minimum efficiency performance standards introduced in 1999 contributed to a jump in efficiency of cold appliances in the UK greater than would have been expected without regulation being put in place. The majority of the reduction in average energy consumption between 1992 and 1999 (between 20-33%), occurred after the introduction of standards in 1999. Ecofys (2012) – The Ecodesign Directive which focusses on mandating energy performance standards for 40 product categories, has been one of the most effective tools at the level of the EU for delivering cost-effective energy savings. Correctly implemented, anticipated to save 400 Mtonnes of CO2 emissions annually, save households 280 euros per year, boost jobs and lessen dependence on energy imports. The success of energy efficiency standards could be replicated through minimum eco-design standards for resource efficiency.\n• As regulations may need to be highly specific, this may limit the impact to the sectors they are specified to (Anderson et al. 2011). Because command-based regulations are sector-specific ,they encourage behaviour change only in the regulated sector, thereby limiting the extent of their impact.\n• Performance standards e.g. on fuel economy can lead to price reductions causing consumption-based rebound effects.\n• The effectiveness of performance standards is contingent on monitoring accuracy, perceptions of significant consequences for not meeting standards and congruence between regulatory and environmental outcomes (Coglianese & Nash, 2017; Skeete, 2017).\n\nPropinquity: C&C seen early on as way to achieve desired outcomes quickly. In phasing out leaded gasoline in Europe, progress would have been slowed without mandating catalytic converters, maxim lead content and tax differentials for instance.\n\nThe UNEP (2021) study identified fuel economy measures through the G7 as indirectly driving material light-weighting and substitution. Taxes on CO2 intensity would deliver the same outcomes and charge-based systems such as tiered parking permits levied by local councils are examples of additional measures currently being used. Risk with indirect approach is that if the indirect route of influence is disrupted, then the policy measure may no longer be effective e.g. move to electrical vehicles. Regarding more intensive use, High occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes as used in the USA are an example of a relevant policy measure, while other measures such as preferential parking has been introduced e.g. in Seattle, Washington."

Performance standards perform slightly better than technology standards here only if compliance charges can be lessened through R&D.\n• Putting in place stretching standards far in advance of implementation can encourage firms to make long-term investments for transforming a sector via innovation.\n• Some evidence of technology standards leading to the development of radically new technologies (Bergek and Berggren, 2014), though risk around picking winners. Technology standards effectively subsidise firm-level R&D, helping overcome a lack of information which can have catalytic effects for innovation (Perman et al. 2011).\n• There is evidence of performance standards driving long-term technological innovation i.e. being technology-forcing (Bergqvist et al. 2013; Bergek and Berggren, 2014) including through process-based improvement (Weiss and Anisimova, 2018) and the development of new products (Grubb and Ulph, 2002; Gerard and Lave, 2005) when well designed (predictable, coordinated and flexible) by creating a stable environment for the adoption and development of technologies, and can also be technology forcing.

    "text": "Business\nPrivate environmental governance refers to governance where the state is not the predominant form of political authority in the regulation of behaviour (Levy and Newell, 2005), and is an umbrella term including non state market-driven governance and civil regulation and liability. We consider the potential contribution of different actors to CE related objectives in the absence of further regulation and the potential impacts of this ‘business as usual’ strategy across the UK.\nThe private sector can in some contexts be a potentially proactive actor in improving environmental performance. There are normative and instrumental reasons why firms might seek to improve their environmental performance without government regulation requiring them to do so. Stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984) holds that firms have a range of stakeholders including but not limited to, its shareholders, with stakeholders understood broadly as individuals or groups affected by, or affecting firms purpose and activities. Under this theory, firm managers having a duty to not only create value for shareholders, but also to account for, and balance the interests of other stakeholders.\nEcological modernisation and green growth suggest environmental protection and economic growth are not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. On this basis, firms may be increasingly inclined to embark on proactive CR strategies based on realising opportunity rather than reactively managing regulatory or forthcoming regulatory pressure (Kramer and Kana, 2006; Zadek, 2000). Changes in business models, products and reverse logistics are needed in most cases to move towards more circular and sustainable economies (Jonken, Faber and Haaker, 2022; Nattassha et al. 2022). Different business models can contribute to greater national circular value creation, resource efficiency and productivity. This includes service-based systems, leasing models and incentivised returns and re-use. While these frequently require government intervention, they can also occur in the absence of external compliance incentives (Auld, Bernstein and Cashore, 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nFirms can be motivated to undertake voluntary environmental improvements in order to cut costs and improve productivity, market products to green consumers with higher willingness to pay for more environmentally performative goods or expand into green markets. In addition firms may undertake voluntary improvements to lessen liabilities and risks of various kinds, enhance reputation capital in support of establishing a license to operate and pre-empt government regulation to reduce potential regulatory burden such as legal costs and monitoring, with the possible aim to weaken regulatory ambition. There are examples of voluntary improvements being made to engage in anticompetitive regulation development e.g. DuPont’s voluntary acceleration of phaseout of CFCs may have encouraged regulators to put pressure on other producers (Lyon and Maxwell, ).\nThere are a range of motivations internal to firms which might encourage improved environmental performance in the absence of overt government regulation – directly increasing profits, helping manage risks, factors around organisational culture and normative drivers. There exists a continued debate over whether going green is financially rational for firms i.e. whether there is a net financial benefit to doing so once costs of CR are accounted for. The costs of firms improving firm environmental performance has been argued in some cases to likely be nominal (Shrivasta, 1995) or potentially recouped. There is the potential in some cases for firms to improve their bottom line through improved environmental performance. Ambec and Lanoie (2008) extended the Porter Hypothesis (1991) which posits that well designed regulation enacted in a manner creating opportunity for innovation, not locking in particular technologies and leaving little room for uncertainty (Porter and van der Linde, 1995) can be responded to by firms innovating at the process level to reduce costs or differentiating at the product level and thereby increasing revenue, by arguing firms can reap financial gain through thse routes without the need for regulatory pressure. Such improvement in environmental performance leading to greater returns can be seen to arise through: 1) cost advantages which arise through eco-efficiencies reducing resource and waste-related production costs and minimising future liabilities; and 2) differentiation advantages which arise through the sale of goods and services with improved environmental performance e.g. in new green markets, thereby increasing sales and revenues. WRAP’s EU-level REBUS project has identified a range of resource-efficient business models (see table ).\nAlternative, more circular business models have been put forward (Bocken et al. 2015) and how firms can interact with these, outlined (Hansen and Revellio, 2020).\nOECD (2018) Business Models for the Circular Economy. Wrap:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel (Wrap)\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nService systems\nProviding a service based upon delivering performance outputs that are linked to products or services. Products could also be designed for disassembly, re-manufacture and re-use.\n\n\nHire and leasing\nLong-term hire and leasing of products can deliver a longer term approach to product durability, with longer service life, lower maintenance load and lower use of materials and CO2.\n\n\nIncentivised returns and re-use\nEncourages customers to return used items for an agreed value. Customers gain value for unwanted items and return products via a convenient system. Collected products are refurbished and sold for re-use on appropriate markets.\n\n\nLong life\nProducts are designed to have a long life time with durability, reducing consumption.\n\n\n\nSelf regulation can take place at the level of single firms or entire industries. Examples at the firm level include triple-bottom line management, such as applying ESG Criteria, CSR strategies or implicit and codified demands between firms for certain CSR practices, known as business to business self-regulation. Reputational risks associated with bad publicity due to malfeasance can encourage consumers to withhold patronage or actively boycott firms. Seeking to avoid this risk may encourage companies to improve their environmental performance. There exist potential financial risks associated with poor environmental performance for firms using equity financing, commercial financing or income generation through the sale of bonds as investor cost of capital may increase for firms perceived as irresponsible. This risk may have grown in recent years in a context of third sector organisations encouraging shareholder action and fiduciary duty dynamics become of wider importance. Sustainability ratings agencies have made the competitiveness of corporate environmental performance far greater in recent decades due to their enhancement of transparency (oekom 2017) and provision of risk information in a way usable by investors. Clarkson (1995) distinguishes on a continuum between reactive, defensive (e.g. of reputation - Zadek (2000), accommodative and proactive approaches. Similarly, Steurer (2013) distinguishes between symbolic, philanthropic, integrative and innovative approaches (Steurer, 2013).\nBusinesses pursue CSR in three basic ways: philanthropic, integrative (where business operations are conducted more responsibly) or innovative (new business models are developed for solving social and environment problems) (Halme and Laurila, 2008). Self regulation can take place at the level of single firms or entire industries and is characterised by the absence of direct government requirements. Examples at the industry level include the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Examples at the firm level include triple-bottom line management, such as applying ESG Criteria between firms for certain CSR practices.\n\nFirm-NGO Partnerships - Partnerships with other stakeholders coming in the form of 1) partnering with an environmental or social group or b) a public-private partnership in which firms, government and NGOs interact towards some common goal. These partnerships can be important for unlocking indirect learning processes and promoting direct specific requirements. Partnering with NGOs can give can generate supportive perceptions of a firm.\nPublic-Private partnerships - Contrastingly to private-private collaborations, public-private partnerships involve firms as part of a broader community of interests in which government and social stakeholders interact to solve a problem. This can involve coordination to address rule or standard setting, implementation or service provision where the relationship can be seen as co-optation, delegation, co-regulating or self-regulation in the shadow of hierarchy. Co-optation; state consultation with private actors. Delegation: States or intergovernmental organisation give private actors responsibilities over governance functions. Coregulation: Involve joint decision making between state and private actors. Self-regulation in the shadow of hierarchy - cases where private actors self-regulate to avoid or reduce threats of state intervention. \nInformation approaches: Information disclosure policies and voluntary labelling programmes. Information disclosure carries its own logic of effectiveness. By making environmental performance more transparent, consumers can act upon this information. It is expected that information can shame firms into acting.  e.g. GRI - firms voluntarily report the environmental and social impacts of their activities. \nEnvironmental Management Systems: The adoption of externally imposed criteria on how to manage a firm’s internal approaches to environmental and social issues. This allows firms to decide which behaviour they will adopt. An example is Europe’s Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) and the ISO 14001. EMS are strongly promoted as they lead to learning within a firm. \n\nMultiple studies have pointed to the economic benefits from the more circular treatment of materials: to firms through cost reductions including from no/low-cost investments (Oakdene Hollins, 2007; 2009; 2017; Wrap, 2016; Eunomia, 2017), increases in total factor productivity (Baptist and Hepburn, 2013) and reductions in exposure to price fluctuations and associated risk premiums for capital (Chatham House, 2012); as well as for households through increased disposable income (Pearce, 2001). Ambec and Lanoie (2008) extended the Porter Hypothesis (1991) to argue firms may be able to reap financial gain through process-level cost reductions and product-level differentiation advantages but without the need for regulatory pressure. On this basis, firms may be expected to pursue business strategies helping realise the value of these opportunities even in the absence of any regulatory pressure (Kramer and Kana, 2006; Zadek, 2000).\nWhile investment costs, opportunity costs and uncertain payoffs (Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler 2016) need to be accounted for, multiple studies have pointed to the potential economic benefits of circular economy business models. In several cases, firms have or are adopting such models in the absence of regulation. A 2009 study by Oakdene Hollins estimated the overall potential gains available to UK businesses of no/low-cost efficiency improvements in energy, waste and water was of the order of £23 billion. A 2017 update quantifying the financial savings of no/low cost resource efficiency specific to material efficiency estimated this to be between £3.2-£4.7 billion per year. Several macroeconomic analyses of circular economy transitions have also pointed to positive impacts on outcomes such as GDP and employment (McCarthy, Dellink and Bibas, 2018; EMF, 2015; Cambridge Econometrics, 2021), though highlighting re-allocation effects across sectors.note oakdene completed 2022 study on value retention.\n‘We observe that a company’s ESG score does have a significant impact on its EV/EBITDA multiple, even after allowing for the impact of other variables generally considered to be value drivers of a business. The results of our analysis show that, on average across our sample, a 10-point difference in an ESG score is associated with an approximate 1.2x higher EV/EBITDA multiple.’ (Deloitte,).\nIn addition, firms may seek to manage a wide range of systemic and company-specific risks which threaten their financial returns through improved environmental performance. Such risks can be present on the supply side, such as the physical risks of climate change on material supply, or financial risk, and the demand side, linked to the loss of markets or competitiveness due to unheeded changes in preferences. New-institutional theory holds that firms seek to maintain practices congruent with institutionally-embedded requirements and norms in order to build and maintain legitimacy in the societies within which they operate. High environmental performance, or the appearance of it, can lend to a corporation’s image, brand integrity and credentials of perceived good corporate citizenship. Mimetic dynamic has been seen to arise within operating contexts of uncertainty and ambiguity, leading to firms adopting new technologies and practices out of fear of falling behind competitors, even when not necessarily the most immediately profitable thing to do. Lastly, individual members of firms such as top executives can play important roles in defining firm behaviour (Weaver et al. 1998; Carroll, 2000) and in an increasing number of cases, are doing so.\nActors external to a firm can be important in driving environmental performance, even when the government is not seeking to overtly regulate. These can include managing risks from external actors such as the state, the public or financial markets, as well as industry-level initiatives. CR can often take place in the ‘shadow of hierarchy’ (Borze and Risse, 2010), with firms responding to the threat of future regulatory by appearing to do something. In addition, reputational risks associated with bad publicity due to malfeasance can encourage consumers to withhold patronage or actively boycott firms. Seeking to avoid this risk may encourage companies to improve their environmental performance. There exist potential financial risks associated with poor environmental performance for firms using equity financing, commercial financing or income generation through the sale of bonds as investor cost of capital may increase for firms which have perceptions of irresponsibility. This risk may have grown in recent years in a context of third sector organisations encouraging shareholder action and fiduciary duty dynamics become of wider importance. Sustainability ratings agencies have made the competitiveness of corporate environmental performance far greater in recent decades due to their enhancement of transparency (oekom 2017) and provision of risk information in a way usable by investors.\nOpportunities and barriers to more circular approaches in the foundation industries have also been highlighted (Hanein et al. 2023).\nDespite there being many examples of firms and sectors improving their environmental performance in the UK and further afield, there are limits to, and constraints on, rational self-enlightenment. The costs of a firm neither reactively nor proactively improving its environmental performance can often be overstated, with there being a divergence between what consumers say and do and the actual share of consumers engaging in environmentally-improved consumption. There has been shown in many instances to be a limited willingness of final consumers to pay a premium for, or even switch their purchase to products with superior environmental performance, especially when they don’t provide immediate benefits (Johnstone and Tan, ). In this sense, the main constraint on the market’s ability to increase the supply of improved environmental performance of goods and services sold, is the market itself. There is often the working assumption that any rational opportunity for maximising profits would already have been exploited by firms.\nGreater CR leading to improved income can often only be applicable to a small number of firms in a given sector, and niche markets, while even for firms which seek to improve their performance, the incremental benefits of improved environmental performance fall while marginal revenues for achieving this, increase, leading to a hypothesised inverted u-shape relationship between economic and environmental performance (Flammer, 2013). Though the risk of boycotts may encourage some improved environmental performance, these having measurable impacts on sales in the long-term can be unusual, while incentives to improve to gain access to socially responsible financing is relatively limited due to the availability of a large number of alternatives and limited evidence of capital markets penalising poor environmental performance. Other barriers to firm improvement include higher internal hurdle rates for environmental investments than other forms of investment, inertia arising from organisational routines, bounded rationality locking firms into certain ways of thinking, and core rigidities, with the resource based view of the firm arguing competitive firm advantage is rooted in the ownership of valuable and difficult to imitate resources and capabilities (Barney, 1991) which can inhibit strategic CR by acting as core rigidities (Gabel & Sinclair-Desagne, 2001). Such lock-in can occur at the level of whole industries.\nThere can be strong incentives for firms to appear responsible, which can encourage firms to put out a visage of responsibility while not taking on the costs of implementing CR, made possible through information asymmetries between the private sector and external actors. Greenwashing can be defined as ‘the selective disclosure of positive information about a company’s environmental and social performance without full disclosure of negative information on these dimensions’ (Lyon and Maxwell, 2004). The degree of greenwashing might be identified by evaluating the gap between rhetoric and reality, while too looking at the motive of the firm. As firms are increasingly expected to display CR characteristics, decoupling can arise between rhetoric and reality and between what is implemented and intentions (Powell and Bromley, 2012). Some degree of greenwashing is inevitable as firms wish to paint themselves in a good light and have power over which information to disseminate. Punitive measures are difficult to implement, but standardisation can act as a regulating force.\nA range of barriers facing businesses exist. For instance, Milios (2018) highlights that remanufacturing can be hampered by it not always being clear under which conditions remanufacturing might impede the rights of original producers, and potential remanufacturers not wanting to be seen as a producer and therefore become economically responsible for collection and recycling of waste products. In addition, the economics of circular business models often don’t make sense, including due to product disassembly being costly in terms of labour requirements.\nHowever and notwithstanding these potential drivers for action, a dominant framing of business activity has been the shareholder value theory (Friedman, 1962) which views an inherent conflict between the goals of environmental protection and firm competitiveness on the basis of it diverting resources from other investments and eroding profits. It has been argued that the assumed benefits of more sustainable or circular practices may be insufficient to outweigh their costs. This can be at the level of cost-reductions, with low-hanging fruit i.e. easy to implement and low-cost changes being available only to some extent, but the costs of deeper improvements increasing over time, such that marginal costs overcome marginal revenues of changes. In addition, differentiation advantages may be overstated due to a limited willingness of final consumes to pay a premium or switch to products with improved CE performance, especially where not user enhancing because they don’t provide immediate benefits or are more costly. In addition, the costs of not improving environmental performance may be overstated. This is linked to a limited willingness to pay a premium for products with improved environmental performance by consumers (included in relation to stated willingness to pay) and opportunities for firms to sell to responsive consumers being relatively small and niche. In addition, other potential drivers of improved behaviour may not be as potent as thought. For instance, although there is some evidence that capital markets may penalise poor environment performance, it isn’t clear that firms are rewarded for broader improvements in CR performance in the long run while in reality, consumer boycotts having a measurable impact on sales are unusual, with effects generally temporary. Vogel (2005) argues that CSR is better understood as a niche rather than generic strategy, with a space for responsible firms in the market economy, but also a large space for less responsible competitors.\nFischer-Kowalski et al. (2010) find in their scenarios of moderation in future resource use, that this cannot be expected from market dynamics alone and therefore will need to be achieved by policy intervention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarriers to more circular approaches for business\n\n\n\n\n\nBarriers are things that restrain change towards a particular outcome. Barriers can represent elements of the status quo which if not managed, can delay or limit change, in some cases indefinitely (OECD, 2009).\nBarriers to CE implementation can arise as a result of the high resource costs of switching to alternative models of production or consumption, an absence of alternative technologies altogether and a range of other economic, policy, technological, social and operational factors. For instance, barriers to the expansion of domestic recycling capacity have been noted to include relatively lower prices for exporting waste which is treated as equivalent to domestic reprocessing in current regulatory frameworks, the volatility of recycling note values in existing packaging recycling note markets and resultant uncertain returns on investments (Iacovidou et al. 2020 in OECD, 2022).\nThe centres making up the NICER Programme and members of the programme’s policy cluster working group, have identified a number of barriers and disincentives which need to be overcome to unlock the benefits of a more sustainable, resource efficient and circular UK economy. In relation to circular economy objectives, these can exist and vary across materials, product end uses, value chain stages, business size and household property type.\nFig . Examples of barriers to a more circular UK economy along the value chain\n\n\nEconomic\nEconomic barriers identified exist at the level of individual producers and consumers and the economy as a whole. While several studies have pointed to the potential economic benefits from the more efficient, circular and sustainable treatment of materials, including to:\n\nFirms, through cost reductions including from no/low-cost investments (Oakdene Hollins, 2007; 2009; 2017; Wrap, 2016; Eunomia, 2017), increases in total factor productivity (Baptist and Hepburn, 2013) and reductions in exposure to price fluctuations and associated risk premiums for capital (Chatham House, 2012; Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler 2016);\nHouseholds, through increased disposable income (Pearce, 2001); and\nThe government, through cost-reductions such as assocated with solid waste management which made up the largest proportion of all UK government environmental protection expenditure in 2019 (£11.6 billion) (ONS, 2021),\n\nthe potential high upfront capital costs for introducing new products, processes, businesses or reverse logistics systems can act as an economic barrier, including for new market entrants. These capital cost will also be associated with opportunity costs for alternative investments that may have greater payoff certainty (Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler, 2016). In addition, CE business models can be associated with higher operating expenditures such as for secondary versus virgin material inputs or for production models requiring higher labour inputs as is often the case at present for improved separation of waste or reverse logistics. Subject to global competition, it can therefore be difficult for producers to supply to the market relatively costly goods and services. Business models optimised to low cost, high volume.\nThere are three main costs associated with investing in resource efficiency: investment costs including transaction costs, opportunity costs and macroeconomic costs (Florian et al 2016). The potential high upfront capital costs for introducing new products, processes, businesses or reverse logistics systems can act as an economic barrier, including for new market entrants. These capital cost will also be associated with opportunity costs for alternative investments that may have greater payoff certainty (Flachenecker, Bleischwitz and Rentschler, 2016). In addition, CE business models can be associated with higher operating expenditures such as for secondary versus virgin material inputs or for production models requiring higher labour inputs as is often the case at present for improved separation of waste or reverse logistics. For instance, where lime-based mortar is used, there is a very high technical potential for the reuse of bricks however this is often not exploited due to high costs (Hopkinson et al., 2018).\nAt the same time and as difficult to disprove due to a lack of evidence regarding successful business cases and proven return on investment, potential differentiation advantages of new products may be undermined by a limited willingness of consumers to pay a premium or switch at all (Leire and Thidell, 2005; Olander and Thogeresen 2014). For instance, the inconvenience and cost of repairing electronics has been identified as a barrier to consumers for adopting these practices (Cole, Cooper and Gnanapragasam, 2016).\n\n\nTechnological\nTechnical and knowledge barriers are the major hindrances for enterprises Other barriers are financial, including financial structures within enterprises, lack of external financial support from banks and high upfront costs, lack of regulatory support (in form of policies and incentives), and lack of institutional and societal support (SEI, 2021).\nTechnological barriers to circular economy objectives in the UK exist at the product and process level, and include poor product design for durability and disassembly, quality issues with secondary materials (Jaeger and Upadhyay, 2020), a lack of technical expertise, skills and training in relevant solutions, a lack of infrastructure such as for waste treatment and technical solutions to support CE such as recovery and sorting of complex materials and gaps in data systems.\n\n\nCultural\nA prominent cultural barrier identified is the lack of public awareness about what the circular economy is and its potential benefits, leading to a lack of demand for relevant products and practices. YouGov poll and highlighted in Ireland’s ‘Whole of Government Circular Economy Strategy’ 2022-23 ((Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, 2021). Linked to this lack of demand is possible lack of confidence in and perceived lesser quality of remanuafactured goods. N. Ireland’s Circular Economy Coalition identified social barriers including that material possessions being associated with wealth/high standard of life (Economy N.I., 2022).\nAmong businesses, hesitancy in adopting CE practices can result from firm core rigidities but also a short-term business culture. Behavioural barriers such as the ‘status quo’ bias can lead to companies underestimating the value of long-term benefits versus short-term costs and/or overestimate the risks associated with such investments (Defra, 2013)."

    "text": "Government\nUK Environmental Law has historical roots but is a relatively young legal field, with what is contemporarily understood as environmental law previously being grounded in laws of nuisance. What we understand as environmental law started as private law. The case of St Helen’s Smelting Co v. Tipping (1865), in which the common law tort of nuisance was the only route through which legal recourse could be established in the instance of environmental harm, with the level of effluent complicit in causing this harm needing to be curbed but no further - indicative of a Coasean rationale, in which only that environmental harm to the two parties in question was accounted for. The central failing of such private law was that it had a poor track record of protecting private property and in ensuring environmental protection beyond the realms of private property, being fragmented in its nature due to environmental harm being resolved in the courts individually.\nThe industrial revolution that swept through Britain mid-18th Century, whilst bringing economic gains too brought environmental and social impacts with it. The first statutory response to industrial pollution was the Alkali Act 1863 affording a new role in enforcement of environmental protection and more centralised regulation to establish homogenised environmental qualities grew in the UK. By focussing on just one environmental medium, perversely the Alkali Act, indicative of the problem of fragmentation, led to increased water pollution, necessitating the development of the later Alkali Act and environmental laws seeking to be more integrative in their response to pollutants. Issues of displacement led to the perceived need for more wholesale and sectorally holistic regulation arising in response to the inability of private regulation to adequately control environmental harms.\nModern environmental law began in the 1960s and was encouraged by new conceptualisations of the global environment leading to an environmental consciousness (Jasanoff, 2004). In recognition of heightening environmental harms from human economies, the laissez faire approach to regulation was recognised as a failure. The scene was set for larger-scale state intervention and the development of a proactive and integrated approach to resolving environmental harm. There was a growing attempt to replace piecemeal regulatory approaches with cross-sectoral approaches, engaging a breadth of actors at multiple scales. Under the Governance of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate for Pollution singular pollutants were dealt with whilst under the EA, the entire human relationship was sought to be dealt with.\nAfter the UK’s rapid economic growth of the 1960s-which saw relatively inert and homogenous wastes replaced by an increasing array of materials- while up into the 1990s, waste was dealt with primarily via landfilling (Greenfield, 2017; Bell et al. 2013). Though fulfilling the principal condition of minimizing public health risks, this predominantely linear model of resource treatment came increasingly under scrutiny as foregone opportunities to reduce virgin material demand and minimise the costs and envronmental impacts of waste treatment were seen.\nInternational action was highly influential at the UK level, with the 1972 UN Conference on Environment and Development acting as a key milestone in this transition. In conjunction with the increasing integration of EU Law into the UK, laws concerning biodiversity, atmospheric pollution and principles such as Sustainable Development began to arise, illustrative of the changing scale of regulation in. Principles more global in their nature such as Sustainable Development and more generalised concern for the human population led to requirements for changes in law. Governance changed from being solely nationally led to Multilateral Agreements e.g. UNFCCC. This shift was encouraged by changing understanding of environmental issues, changing principles and changing governance. Looking now, the impact of EU membership on UK Environmental Law is difficult to overestimate. The 1960s - 80s period in environmental legislation was dominated typically by command and control approaches.\nThe rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s saw the Command and Control approach to environmental regulation increasingly questioned amidst a rolling back of the state. A preference for market based and multi-actor governance arose in response to the perceived inflexibility of direct regulation. Reflexive laws such as EIAs required less of administration yet placed risks of entrusting those standing to gain from the receipt of a permit in the position to conduct them, with downplaying certain impacts proving irresistible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n‘regulatory failures’ and categorised into:\n\nType I regulatory failures: where government actors fail to intervene where they otherwise could have realistically promoted greater efficiency; and\nType II regulatory failures: where government intervention has led to a less efficient situation than before or what might have otherwise realistically been due e.g. to poor policy design, poor translation and implementation, net benefits being lower than expected due to optimism bias or due to missing information (Hudson, 2019).\n\nA number of Type I regulatory failures limiting the move to a more circular economy in the UK have been identified. Gaps in the current regulatory landscape include a lack of standards to guide CE activity, insufficiently leveraged regulations such as expanding ‘right to repair’ legislation to small electronics, limited enforcement of laws currently in place, a tax framework that does not incentivise CE activities such as VAT exemptions in place for new builds not being available to refurbishment activity. A regulatory backlog linked particularly to the UK leaving the EU has been cited as a factor here. A lack of coherence and consistency in existing and planned policy interventions and legislation has also been cited as a regulatory barrier (see text box below).\nOne example of a type II regulatory failure in the UK is that predominant models of extended producer responsibility in the UK are based on ‘collective responsibility’, with the costs for the collection and recycling shared among participating companies based on the amount of products put on the market. This approach lowers the ambition of individual companies to develop more circular products as a company would have to bear the costs of improved design and production changes while the benefits of the reduced end-of-life costs would be shared with all other companies in the market i.e. there is a split incentive as a result (Van Rossem et al. 2006).\nAnother example often pointed to is the legal definition of waste and ‘end of life’ (EoL) and ‘end of waste’ (EoW) criteria (CIWM, ). As when something is classified as a waste this has implications for how it can then be used, the current definition of waste has been cited as limiting reuse activity by local authorities and limiting the use of spoils and sands from domestic extraction activities. At the same time, a key focus of waste regulation is reducing public the health risks of waste, and the potential for increased risk by moving away from the relatively risk-averse regulatory framework currently in place need to be kept in mind.1 A further example is current UK Government policy favouring recycling over reuse for construction (Kay and Essex, 2008).\nFrom the 1970s, the EU Waste Framework Directive (only brought into UK law in 2008) introduced definitions and basic concepts such as the ‘waste hierarchy’ into the UK policy sphere and initiated more detailed measurement of the generation and treatment of some types of waste (particularly household),. This laid the grounds for tracking progress against subsequent targets introduced via the Landfill Directive [99/31/EC]) on reducing landfilling and increasing recycling. A range of EU-led directives followed:\n\nthe Packaging Directive [94/62/EC] and Producer Responsibility Obligations which placed requirements on eligible businesses to recover a portion of the packaging they placed on the market. This was operationalised in the UK through a tradable note system;\nthe End-of-Life-Vehicles Directive [2000/53/EC] which required producers to introduce take-back network for vehicles to incentivise improved product design and stimulate secondary markets, while meeting targets for reuse, recycling and recovery;\nthe Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE) [2002/96/EC] requiring producers of specific categories of electronics and electrical equipment (EEE) to register with an approved compliance scheme and pay for the costs associated with their end-of-life treatment;\nthe ROHS Regulations [2002/95/EC] prohibiting EEE containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants from being placed on the market in order to reduce issues with the disposal and recycling of WEEE;\nThe Batteries and Accumulators and Waste Batteries and Accumulators Directive [2006/66/EC] introduced similar material exclusion and producer responsibility requirements for batteries and accumulators while too banning residual treatment of untreated industrial components;\nThe Eco-design of Energy-Using Products Directive [2005/32/EC] enabled governments to set performance standards for specific products relating to their energy efficiency. While the directive focussed primarily on energy efficiency, from 2019, a shifted towards aspects of resource efficiency were with rules introduced requiring certain EEE products to be longer-lasting and spare-parts to be supplied for a minimum amount of time that could be used with commonly available tools and without damaging products Bungaard et al. (2017; Parliament UK, 2008).\n\nDevolution from the end of the 1990s saw the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly increasingly responsible for the direction of their respective waste and wider resource regulatory regimes, while local authorities also assumed key roles as individual or joint waste authorities. This entrenched localised discretion over budgetary allocations, materials collected, collection frequencies, treatment arrangements and communications approaches for local authority collected waste (Abbott et al. 2011).\nA UK-level Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) framework called ‘Changing Patterns’ was established in 2003 (Defra, 2003), with a general action plan for its implementation proposed in chapter 3 of the 2005 UK Sustainable Development Strategy (Defra, 2005). The 2005 strategy called for improvement in three major areas in order to decouple resource utilisation from economic growth and detoxify the environment:\n\n“Better products and services, which reduce the environmental impacts from the use of energy, resources, or hazardous substances;\nCleaner, more efficient production processes (doing more with less), which strengthen competitiveness; and\nShifts in consumption towards goods and services with lower impacts” (DEFRA, 2005: 44).\n\nThe 2008 Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) required all member states to produce Waste Prevention Programmes by the end of 2013 (EC 2008) to deliver preventive and integrated approaches to tackling waste efficienctly. These were developed by each of the UK’s constituent countries. Growing perceptions of the threat of resource insecurity was a significant driver in interest in resource-related governance and resource efficiency, and the 2012 Resource Security Action Plan led by Defra and BIS focussed on metals and minerals perceived to be of particular strategic importance but with uncertain supply. As part of the plan, strategies focussed on improved resource efficiency and increased secondary material use were viewed as promising ways to tackle potential scarcities. Th plan emphasised recovery moreso than opening up new sources of materials (Hill, 2016). Around this time, the Technology Strategy Board (now Innovate UK), supported small businesses in trying out new concepts related to resource efficiency via, for example, its Innovation Challenge Fund (Oswald et al. 2018).\nFollowing the 2017 Chief Scientific Advisors Office’s report ‘From Waste to Resource Productivity’ which called for the development of a national strategy to deliver this transition, the Resources and Waste Strategy (RWS) for England published in 2018 by Defra sets out a strategic ambition to double resource productivity and eliminate avoidable waste of all kinds by 2050 in line with the direction of the 25 Year Environment Plan. A consultation for an updated Waste Prevention Programme released in 2021 expanded particularly on interventions to be taken to move waste treated up the hierarchy.\nAfter the UK’s EU Exit, the Environment Bill was introduced to provide the required primary legislation framework for realising many of the policy aims of the RWS. The waste and resource efficiency chapter of the Bill included the means to introduce measures such as:\n\nExtended Producer Responsibility Schemes – Reforming existing schemes to make producers bear the full net-cost of collecting and treating waste associated with the products they place on the market and the introduction of fee-modulation to incentivise more sustainable design. Expanding the mechanism to cover new product and material categories starting with textiles; bulky waste such as mattresses and furniture; vehicle tyres; fishing gear and certain materials used in the construction and demolition sector;\nA Deposit-Return Scheme – a charge-rebate system consisting of front-end charges on goods combined with a rebate upon their correct disposal to improve secondary raw material availability;\nImproved consistency of recycling collections – providing the powers to ensure all LAs collect a consistent, minimum core set of dry recycling and organic recycling materials. Also to give the power to require businesses and public-sector organisations to segregate a core set of dry materials from their waste;\nFood waste measures - creating an obligation to redistribute food surplus and provide the power to impose mandatory food-waste reduction targets on businesses;\nSingle-use plastic measures - to add additional products to a list of SUP items where a separate charge can be imposed on a product-by-product basis;\nEco-labelling - providing the policy framework to require mandatory provision of consumer information via eco-labels; and\nEco-design measures allowing the SoS to have powers to set product standards relating to resource efficiency dimensions of non-energy related products such as repairability, durability and recycled content.\n\nThe UK Circular Economy Package (CEP) 2020 outlines a legislative framework for waste reduction, management and recycling. BEIS Right to Repair, ecodesign regulations for energy-using products. Criticals Minerals Strategy. A new tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content has been introduced by Treasury\nClimate Change Act (2008). CCC interest in resource efficiency to deliver a more CE – 6th Climate Budget Report. UK Industrial Decarbonisation Strategy heavily references the circular economy as a methodology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through eliminating waste, keeping materials in use and capturing carbon through regenerating and restoring natural systems.\n\nScotland, Wales, N. Ireland\nThe responsibility for environmental policy and regulation and circular economy is devolved in the UK and across with countries varying in their autonomy. For this reason there are different approaches to achieving objectives as well as varying levels of activity across each of the nations. In England and Northern Ireland, dedicated government departments define overall environmental policy and establish the legal framework: the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in England and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland. Defra has lead responsibility for all environmental policy areas apart from climate change mitigation, for which the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has the policy lead. In addition, the Department for Transport promotes sustainable mobility."

The Sustainable Clothing Roadmap was established in 2007 to increase sustainability throughout the clothing supply chain, thereby maximising reuse and recycling of fibres. It is coordinated by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and is part of Defra’s Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) Programme.

Along similar timelines, expectations and enablers of extra-financial information disclosure by firms have grown, with data on company- and product-level performance now more widely published in company reports. These are often collected and made more legible by third-party organisations such as technology solutions firms, ratings agencies and NGOs. For instance, a growing number of tools and standards have been developed to support product and firm-level measurement of material flows (including those secondary), including the Ellen McArthur Foundation’s ‘Circulytics’, the Boston Consulting Group’s ‘Circelligence’, WBCSD’s ‘Circular Transition Indicators’ and the GRI 306 Waste Standard.

Actions previously unregulated have become subject to regulation (juridification) to attempt to manage risk (EA, 2014). As environmental law has sought to deepen its mandate to prevent harm, it has increasingly incorporated a risk management approach as a forward looking means of safeguarding against risk. We no longer seek to be protected against harms but also protected against the potential for future harm - a more ambitious mandate. Law seeks to reduce the likelihood of environmental harm occurring or seeks redress for harm that has been caused. Risk is a function of the potential magnitude of a harm times by its likelihood of occurrence. Risk is socially constructed, determined not only by magnitude and frequency but too by the perceptivity of an agent to potential harm occurring. Negative implications can arise from seeking to control it as well as positive. Recognising this potential, we are forced to analyse risk management in terms of the risk it may bring up, seeking to ensure that policy responses are at least neutral and hopefully bring a net benefit (Goklany, 2002).↩︎"

A key motivation for their use is achieving sought outcomes without the need for additional regulation, and in some cases sidestepping inertia that can be associated with the policy-making process. Voluntary approaches can be introduced as an alternative to regulation or as a supplement to it (Delmas and Terlaak, 2002). There are examples of voluntary approaches achieving positive change in the UK in relation to CE objectives and those wider, suggesting these can be made to work when well-designed and targeted (OECD, 1999). Voluntary approaches can help address regulatory and data gaps - in some cases with rapidity - and help encourage beyond-compliance improvements to deliver positive net-benefits (Wrap, 2023).\nWhile effective design and coordination can overcome some barriers to voluntary action, the effectiveness of voluntary approaches can be curtailed by economic limits to voluntarism along with a lack of enforceable commitments and scope for non-interaction or free-riding. A willingness to refrain from regulatory approaches in favour of those voluntary may run the risk of reducing government negotiating power in delivering objectives (Rennings et al. 1997). Voluntary approaches should be viewed as a useful complement in a policy mix for CE-related change when well-designed and in the right context (these conditions are further explored here), but not be relied upon solely nor replace existing regulations."

Wrap introduced its first VA in the UK in 2005 and since, has overseen the introduction of several further agreements which have been reported to achieve improvements in their areas of focus. The UK Plastics Pact - a collaboration between 68 retailers, brands, makers of packaging and waste and recycling companies - introduced in 2018 was reported to have achieved an 84% reduction in problematic and unecessary plastics between 2018-21 in unit terms, and a 57% reduction in those products in mass. Further, businesses taking part have been reported to have a higher level of recycled content and use less plastic than the industry average. The Pact also introduced a target for all plastics packaging to be either reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.\nEngland’s Environment Agency also reported improvements through the VAs organised to reduce industrial emissions. For instance, ‘there was a 17% reduction in overall emissions reported during TP4 from the 53 sectors in the CCA scheme.’ (EA, 2023).\nCourtauld 2025 (C2025) aims to achieve a 20% per capita reduction in UK food and drink waste associated with production and consumption by 2025, relative to 2015 levels. 2018 data appears to show progress is on track to achieve this objective: ‘per capita food waste generated in the United Kingdom, including inedible parts, fell by approximately 7% between 2015 and 2018, from 154 kg to 143 kg. In the same period, it is estimated that there has been a 7% per capita reduction in annual GHG emissions associated with food and drink consumed in the United Kingdom’ (Defra, 2022).\nVAs have been shown to deliver benefits elsewhere. For instance, the Dutch Target Group Policy, comprising a series of negotiated agreements with industry has been generally regarded as successful in achieving emission reductions. Asensio & Magali (2017) find participants in the US Department of Energy’s Better Building Challenge programme in LA, which provides energy audits to support US commercial and industrial building owners who commit to reducing energy and water consumption, achieved energy savings of 18.7% via building technology upgrades. A key argument put forward for the effectiveness of VAs relates to the rapidity with which they can achieve objectives. Goodwin (2015) and Sitra (2019) argue that voluntary instruments such as VAs and VIS can offer a faster way to bring about action by avoiding the legal process (Goodwin, 2015; Sitra, 2019).\nHowever, not all studies paint the effectiveness of VAs in such a positive light. In a meta-study of UK VAs, McCarthy and Morling (2015) found 82% of reviewed VAs scored poorly in relation to either: 1) level of uptake (participation rate); 2) target ambition (the stringency of the targets relative to the policy objective); or 3) target achievement (the extent to which voluntary targets are realised). A 1999 review by the OECD found that although ‘stipulated environmental targets are generally met, the achievement is [often] driven by factors other than the agreement itself – in other words firms would have done what the agreement stipulates even in its absence.’ (OECD, 1999).\nThere is also a need to consider the activities of non-signatories by comparison to understand the overall impact and approximate the ‘do nothing’ option. Berlin and Prakash (2015) find participants in the Global Compact perform worse than non-participants on costly environmental and human rights performance aspects and show improvements on only more superficial dimensions. Marx and Cuypers (2010) found the Forest Stewarship Council (FSC) had a limited impact in halting deforestation, not least because of the limited number of countries with FSC certification, particularly, large developing ones with significant forest areas experiencing high rates of forest degradation and loss. The EU’s negotiated CO2 agreements with car-makers were not on track to meet required targets and have since been replaced by standards.\nRegarding average effects per participant, for negotiated agreements in particular, regulations/standards may need to be set at the level of the lowest common denominator, retarding the development of more ambitious environmental policy. One critique is that VAs may perversely recognise the wrong firms, with such adverse selection occurring as a result of firms seeking to ‘gain signaling and insurance benefits without putting forth the required effort’ (Lenox and Nash 2003: 344). In the UK context, Morakinyo and Stathopoulou (2021) found that firms with lower levels of environmental efficiency received higher CCA tax discounts (Morakinyo and Stathopoulou, 2021).\nThe EMF’s “Global Commitment” voluntary initiative for companies to reduce single-use plastic showed in its most recent annual report that members have made limited progress in reducing virgin plastic use since 2018 and with a high likelihood of missing 2025 targets for reusable, recyclable and compostable packaging (EMF, 2022).\nA 2011 review of the effectiveness of voluntary agreements in the publication ‘the Economics of Wase and Waste Policy’ found ‘empirical evidence suggests that voluntary approaches are not likely to be as effective as pricing instruments in delivering significant behaviour change’.\nDefra’s Resources and Waste highlights the activities of ‘VinylPlus’ - a European-wide Industry voluntary commitment representing the whole value chain of the PVC industry and with the aim of achieving 800,000 tonnes recycled annually across Europe by 2020. Though this figure was missed in the target year, it has since been reached in 2021 and 2022 (VinylPlus, 2023), with an estimated 35% recycling rate now estimated to be achieved across Europe and reduction in the emissions intensity and energy consumption of production of 14.4% and 9.5% between 2007-08 and 2015-16. The scheme has also further developed recycled PVC measurement systems by tracking both how much PVC waste has been recycled by recyclers and converters and how much recycled PVC has been used in new products.\n\n\nVIS\nEMS such as the ISO 14000 series are arguably the most widely adopted form of voluntary corporate environmental policy (Darnall, 2008), with x certifications issued globally. These function by seeking to embed specific practices in firm operations such that environmental protection become integral to activities (Darnall, 2008). The success of their uptake has been attributed to their flexible, procedural-based approach given they do not specify substantive improvements (Testa et al. ).\nEMAS is a ‘voluntary EU environmental management scheme to enable organisations to evaluate, report and improve their environmental performance.’ introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1836/93 (European Court of Auditors, 2023). A 2017 review by the European Commission found that ‘although registered organisations generally benefitted from EMAS in environmental terms, they struggled to reduce their waste generation and material consumption, which even increased in some cases’ (EC, 2017 in European Court of Auditors, 2023).\nThere is evidence of the uptake of VIS in firms leading to a reduction in waste generated (Melynk et al. 2003), wastewater management (Darnall and Kim, 2012), resource use (Rao & Hammer, 1999), and certain emissions (Szymanski & Tiwari, 2004; Darnall, Henriquez and Sadorsky, 2008). ISO 14001 adoption led to a reduction in toxic emissions in electronic plants in Canada (Russo, 2009). A meta-analysis of 94 studies found a generally positive relationship between the uptake of ISO 14001 and indicators of improved management practice and employee awareness.\nHowever, the impacts of ISO certification have been argued to be substantively small in most cases (Coglianese and Nash, 2001) and a more ambiguous relationship between the adoption of EMS and indicators environmental performance has been found in several studies. King et al. (2005) found there to be no effect on environmental performance among US manufacturing firms of ISO 14001 certification. In Sweden, Zobel found no statistically significant difference between ISO certified and non-certified manufacturing firms holding for prior environmental performance, with adopting firms seeing some positive effects on energy use and waste generation/treatment, whereas non-adopting firms performed better for air emissions. Barla (2007) found worse environmental outcomes in Canadian pulp and paper mills after certification. The Europe-wide EMS (EMAS) was found to be associated with symbolic behaviour among firms in Spain examined rather than genuine performance improvements (Martín de Castro et al. 2017).\nThis can be seen as due to several features of VIS including that targets are self-created - meaning they can be more readily limited in aspiration, including being constrained by their voluntary nature.\n\n\nPublic voluntary challenges\nBehavioural effects of Food Waste Reduction Week ( ) for those that it reached was around 60% (Wrap, 2023).\n\n\n\n\nReviews have generally shown that voluntary initiatives benefit only when confined to soft issues, though this is not always the case. Reasons for a lack of effectiveness can include: scope for free-riding; non-enforceable nature of the agreements; and a lack of transparency. Voluntary approaches can be characterized by being too unambitious, with levels of abatement premised on goodwill or rational self-enlightenment. As opportunities for painless pollution prevention have been increasingly exhausted for some time (Walley and Whitehead, 1994).\n\n\nCost-effectiveness and efficiency\nSeveral studies have shown a positive net present value of voluntary agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a history of voluntary initiatives seeking to improve the environmental performance of textiles produced and consumed in the UK. The Sustainable Clothing Roadmap established by Defra in 2007, involved over 300 companies in an attempt to increase sustainability throughout the clothing supply chain (Defra, 2009) including through maximising the reuse and recycling of fibres. The linked Sustainable Clothing Action Plan updated in 2010 set out agreed stakeholder actions (Defra, 2011) across priority areas including consumption trends and behaviour; awareness raising; creating market drivers; and improving traceability, and worked through ‘coordinating’ action by stakeholders. Building off these, the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan 2020 Commitment (SCAP) voluntary agreement launched in 2012 by Wrap sought to further improve the environmental and social performance of the UK clothing system. The SCAP 2020 Final Report found the benefit to cost ratio of the textiles-focussed VA running to 2020 was 2:1. The Textiles 2030 Agreement, also coordinated by Wrap was launched in 2022.\nAlso coordinated by Wrap, VAs established as part of the Courtauld 2025 Agreement focussed on reducing waste and improving wider environmental performance in the agri-food sector (making up around 10% of UK GVA) were estimated to have a benefit to cost ratio of 6:1 with costs estimated to be in the range of 0.3-0.8Bn GBP including costs to government for sponsoring the agreement and in foregone Landfill Tax revenue (Wrap, 2020). This set of agreements were since replaced by Courtauld 2030 in 2021, which increased the ambition of targets (Wrap, 2022).\nThe UK National Industrial Symbiosis Programme was a free at point-of-receipt, advice and networking programme managed by a private company ‘International Synergies’, which sought to facilitate industrial symbiosis3 and identify sustainable resource management solutions for business. After the trialling of three pilot schemes in 2003 in Scotland, West Midlands and Yorkshire & Humberside, the programme received £27 million funding from Defra over three years to roll it out across nine English regions and was operational to approximately 2013 and was discontinued due to failure to establish a commercial model. Similar programmes were also initiated in Wales, N.Ireland & Scotland (SISP) (International Synergies,). Estimated benefits of the programme from 2005-2013 in England include 47 million tonnes of landfill diversion, 42 million tonnes of CO2 reduced and 45 million tonnes of materials recovered and reused, as well as cost-savings of over a billion pounds and 10,000 jobs. Manchester Economics assessed the programme as having a cost-benefit ratio of between 32:1 and 53:1 (Scott et al. 2016).\nIn addition, there may be ‘hedging’ benefits to the use of VAs. In a context of uncertainty regarding potential costs of regulation, voluntary agreements can give the opportunity to begin environmental improvements with less risks of costs outweighing benefits and with greater flexibility (Defra, 2011)."

From the perspective of government, VAs ‘can be set up without the need for new legislation’ and therefore avoid associated resource costs including collecting information and required labour inputs (Wrap, 2021; Frey, 1997; Bauer, Busch and Tuncer, 2023). At the same time, VAs can require government funding either directly or indirectly and funding models for previous ventures generally resemble projects rather than longer-term programmes. Comparatively and for EMS, costs to government for routes by which they can leverage support e.g. via endorsement activities, are likely to be relatively small or non-existent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, financial resources may be required. The costs of negotiating and administering VAs as part of the US EPA’s Project XL were estimated to be $450,000 per firm (Blackman & Mazurek (2001).

When public funding was reduced, the programme was terminated despite high reported BCA.\nWRAP Electrical and Electronic Equipment Sustainability Action Plan (ESAP) : ‘Seeks to catalyse sector action, share evidence and bring the many different stakeholders to provide tangible economic and environmental benefits’ (Defra, 2014).

WRAP was unable to meet their business plan targets for funding from businesses and governments to progress interventions in the sector."

    "text": "Positive and negative spillovers\n‘Spillovers’ are the effects on actors other than participants of VIs, which can occur through dynamics such as: the diffusion of technology; improved data, metrics and transparency; reductions in defensive expenditures by regulated parties and government legal costs; and and crowding in of intrinsic motivations (Frey, 1997).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, can fosters positive commitments to achieve shared goals amongst firms, and in doing so reduces resistance, resentment and defensive expenditures by regulated parties, crowds in the intrinsic motivation of regulated agents and reduces governments’ legal costs (Frey, 1997). Can help exploits firms’ knowledge, resources and innovative capabilities, helping them develop new capabilities. Can reduces the need for mandatory regulation, its associated informational and cost requirements e.g. regarding best available processes or technologies and associated regulatory costs for governments while helping fill ‘gaps’ in existing regulatory systems (Blackman et al. 2012).\nCan be used to build state regulatory capacity e.g. Law 99 in Colombia was followed by 65 VAs which sought to establish more co-operative relationships between firms and promote information exchange between themselves and industry to advance environmental performance in the absence of well-functioning C&C regulations, while facilitating the development of regulatory capacity (Blackman et al. 2012). Also applies to new areas in which to apply regulation. Supports learning, and helps preventing Type II errors where incorrect interventions are made.\nFirms also can hold their supply chains to their EMS standards, alleviating pressures on government regulatory costs and extending governance beyond the remit of firms in international settings (Darnall, Henriquez and Sadorsky, 2008). In the pressure-treated wood industry, Hsueh (2013) found an association between reductions in chromated copper arsenate as covered by VAs with the EPA and a reduction in arsenic levels otherwise not covered by the agreement indicating the potential for cross-media impacts.\nSelf-reflection in firms through applying VIS and the monitoring of nonconformities, computerisation of environmental management systems and more systematic auditing can help overcome willful ignorance and led to better compliance with other regulation (Boiral, 2011; Potoski & Prakash, 2005). This has been shown in China among firms adopting ISO 14001 certifications (McGuire, 2014), though also no effect was found between certifications and compliance with the UK’s Integrated Pollution Prevention & Control Regime (Dahlstrom et al. 2003). Dahlstrom et al. (2003) find certification improved only procedural aspects of UK manufacturing plants rather than legal compliance, numbers of complaints etc. Even therefore if we support the benefits of EMS, the efficacy of regulatory relief remains unclear.\nEMS can reduce costs of compliance with other laws by introducing standardized environmental audits acknowledged by the state. Can be used to fulfill requirements of national legislation and thus reduce compliance costs for both the state and companies.\nHowever, negative spillovers with the regulatory system and long-term environmental improvement may also arise. This can be due to the adoption of more modest improvements voluntarily leading to regulators not imposing further requirements, even where environmental beneficial and economically efficient such as was found to occur in Leon, Mexico with negotiated agreements between tanneries and the state (Blackman, 2008)."

A 2022 OECD snapshot of UK CE progress recommends “continuing and enhance initiatives for private sector action on circular economy, including support for voluntary agreements, innovative research and co-operation with local authorities and civil society.”\nHowever, there are risks to relying on voluntary approaches for the following reasons. Voluntary approaches play a role in starting the regulatory process. However, switching from mandatory, state regulation, to voluntary business-led regulation may ultimately reduce incentives to make environmental investments."

To assess effectiveness, we capture evidence on the effect of instruments in relation to objectives such as reducing (primary) resource use, waste generation, reducing leakage and improving waste treatment and including the immediacy with which these effects arise and certainty of meeting aims (predictability). We also consider evidence on how efficiently outcomes are delivered (value for money) and the role of instruments in moving the UK towards a more optimal distribution of goods, services and pollution (allocative efficiency). We include findings from both cost-effectiveness analysis3 and cost-benefit analysis4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial cost to the public sector\n\n\n\n\n\nA key part of moving from theoretical to actual benefits is political and administrative feasibility (the ability to put a policy into effect in a given context), with government affordability an important parts of this (OECD, 1999). In addition to considering evidence on abatement and compliance costs from the perspective of the regulatee, we look for evidence on direct and indirect administrative costs to government (including at policy design and enforcement stages) of instruments, as well as evidence on revenues generated which can offset these (HMT, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-run effects\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look for evidence on the long-run effects of instruments and their ability to meet regulatory aims persistently into the future while providing incentives for continued improvements beyond the minimum. This includes their continued effectiveness under a variety of circumstances and resilience to external changes such as inflation, ability to be updated in response to new information and capacity to harness technological change through providing incentives for innovation over time so as to lower the costs of achieving goals over time (Fiorino, 2004).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributional and equity effects\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the net-effects of instruments on different people and groups, and how these may exacerbate pre-existing inequities (Bryant and Bailey, 1997). Evidence of regressive effects across income strata, geography concerning any of the groups identified by the Equality Act 2010 as well as disproportionate burdens on small and micro businesses are sought to be captured (RPC, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpillovers\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look for evidence on spillovers, both positive and negative and including: 1) Soft effects such as impacts on attitudes, awareness and learning; 2) Wider economic impacts including on innovation and trade; and 3) Perverse incentives and any contribution to potentially unintended consequences such as negatively impacting competition or giving rise to cross-media impacts.5"

    "text": "Modelling blueprints\nTo inform the modelling of policy pathways, one output of the review is a set of ‘modelling blueprints’ (Donati et al. 2020). These represent a collection of assumptions for inputting to utilised appraisal frameworks that have been derived from findings in our evidence review.\nThese modelling inputs include factors such as: the potential immediacy of an instrument, participation or penetration rates, scale of effect per participant and knock-on effects. For instance, a voluntary approach could be expected to have a lesser participation rate than a mandatory approach. These blueprints are then used in NICER outputs such as the ce-observatory as a basis to model possible impacts of policies alongside additional assumption including:\n\nThe scope of a lever e.g. whether a policy is applied to computers or all small appliances;\nTo whom the lever would apply and any exemptions;\nThe focus of the instrument e.g. reducing production leakage, lightweighting and material substitution or lifespan extension;\nAt what level the lever is set e.g. the length of the mandatory minimum lifetime of product; and\nWhen the lever is introduced, including accounting for sequencing and interaction effects.\n\nWe outline the input requirements of core appraisal methodologies below, which are increasingly being used in conjunction with one another to answer stakeholder quetions relating to the circular economy (Hellweg et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost-benefit analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general steps of CBA are (Boardman et al. ; Atkinson et al. 2018):\n\nSelecting the portfolio of options for projects or policies;\nEstablishing a baseline for comparison to indicate the counterfactual;\nDetermine who has ‘standing’ and we are interested in the benefits and costs of counting i.e. the affected population for a study e.g. a watershed’s population; \nIdentify, list and quantify potential physical impacts for the life of the project or policy; \nMonetize impacts for each time period; \n\nAll goods and services for which individuals have preferences and therefore value having more of than current provisions & all the things people wants where provision has an opportunity cost.\nCalculating the net sum of all the relevant WTPs and WTAs for a project outcome or policy change defines the total economic value (TEV) of any change in wellbeing due to a project or policy. TEV can be characterised differently according to the type of economic value arising. Total Economic Value is the summation of use and non-use values. Use value is understood as welfare generated through the actual utilization of the environment and can be further categorized into two forms of actual use values - direct and indirect, in addition to an option value of later use (Pearce et al. 1989). Direct-use values refer to welfare that the current utilization of a resource confers such as water in a production process or for recreation. Direct use values will either be derived consumptively or non-consumptively depending on whether the utilization of those resource lead it to being rendered unusable to other potential beneficiaries. Indirect use-values are those indirect benefits of ecosystems which impact welfare through the services that ecosystems provide (Munasinghe and Schwab, 1993). ‘Option use value’ refers to the preferences people may have for utilizing a resource in the future. Non-use values are those non-instrumental benefits attributed to the environment and includes ‘existence values’ i.e. the preference a society has for knowing a particular resource exists in and of itself; ‘altruistic value’ i.e. the preferences a society may have for others within the current generation being able to use the resource in question; and ‘bequest values’ - the preferences societies have for passing on resources to future generations. \nBenefits - Outputs of the project which increase human welfare, the value of which are assessed based on how much someone is willing to pay for that benefit, even for the likes of avoided costs. A benefit or gain in an individual’s wellbeing (utility or welfare) can be measured by the maximum amount of goods or services – or money income (or wealth) – that he or she would be willing to give up or forego in order to obtain the change. Demand curves for environmental goods and amenities and therefore WTP can be affected  (moved out and slope changed) by: 1) recognition of the importance of a good (increased recognition of the value of clean water, clean air); 2) knowledge of an additional cost accrued through using a good (e.g. illness through GM crops).\nCosts = Outputs of a project that decrease human welfare, which include input costs. Taxonomy depends on kind of project e.g. conservation projects might be decomposed into acquisition, establishment, operations and maintenance costs, transaction and opportunity costs. Generally they are decomposed into: 1) Capital costs; 2) Operation Costs; 3) Externality Costs. In a more traditional economic sense, these are measured as the cost of producing a product (if produced via inputs on the free market then this can be valued easily) and the opportunity cost of using these inputs (consists of the maximum value of other outputs to which the resources used in one way could have been used in the second most efficient manner).\nPrivate and Social Costs: Private costs accrue to those making a product. Social costs accrue to the society surrounding that person making the product and is the summation of all costs (MSC + MPC).\n\nAggregation then involves all benefits and costs being summed to calculate net benefits while discounting for future benefits and costs depending on the social discount rate; \n\nWe discount future values into those that are present-day through the use of a discount rate to account for society’s preferences for benefits now rather than later and its lesser concern for costs in the future versus those now on one hand, and the opportunity cost of capital given economic productivity on the other (Speer et al. 2015). The choice of discount rate embodies important normative assumptions regarding intergenerational equity and short-termism. Boardman et al. (2006) recommend a real social discount rate of 3.5% be used for studies 1-50 year into the future, with this increasing past a 50 year period. \nSensitivity analysis can then be used to test the sensitivity of the net benefit to changes in its determinants as an indication of uncertainty;\n\nRisk and uncertainty: Benefits and costs will not be known with certainty. While conventions vary, it seems fair to distinguish “risk” from “uncertainty” in clarifying what this means and its implications for CBA. A risk context is one where benefits and/or costs are not known with certainty, but a probability distribution is known. Sometimes these probability distributions can be very crude. On some occasions they can be sophisticated. A context of uncertainty is different. There is no known probability distribution. End points might be known, i.e. it is known or expected that the value cannot be less than a number, and that it cannot be more than another number. But, in other cases, there may be pure uncertainty in the sense that “anything may happen”. \nIf the context is one of uncertainty, i.e. the distribution of benefits (costs) is not known, then, at the very least, CBA requires that a sensitivity analysis is performed. Sensitivity analysis requires that the CBA is computed using different values of the parameters about which there is uncertainty. Such procedures require some assumption about likely minima and maxima, but do not necessarily make assumptions about the distribution of values between these limits. For example, if a discount rate of 4% is chosen as the central case, then, say, 2 and 6% could also be chosen for a sensitivity analysis. One possible outcome is that the sign of the net benefits will be unaffected by these alternatives, in which case the analysis is said to be “robust” with respect to these assumptions. In other cases, changing assumptions may alter the CBA result. \n\n\nResults are presented either as a net benefit (B-C) or a benefit-cost ratio (B/C); \nOptions are selected based on the following decision-rules:\n\nIf options are mutually exclusive, choose X because it has the highest Net-Benefit. If options can be chosen independently, choose X,Y, or Z, because all have NB &gt; 0, and these can be ranked by their cost-benefit ratio. If options can be chosen independently, but money is limited (£100), then choose Y and Z because they provide the highest total NB before money runs out (Ranked by B/C). \n\n\n\nDiscounting is used to account for:\n\npositive temporal preferences of society for benefits now over benefits in the future, and lesser concern for costs arising in the future than those in the present. Simply put people consider £1 now to be more valuable than £1 in the next period, such that individuals would be indifferent between a £1 now and somewhat more than £1 next year. This can be due to impatience, survival risks and us being richer later on (so marginal value of the capital will then be less). This extra is called the rate of time preference (RTP); \neconomic productivity - rather have £1 now than later because of a positive rate of interest in the economy and opportunity costs being equal to returns on investment. This stems from the fact capital is productive and that by investing in capital now, we can ensure greater returns in the next period. Simply put, for every £1 we invest now, we get £1 plus some extra back in the next period. This extra is called the opportunity cost rate (OCR) since it is the opportunity cost (the consumption foregone in the next period) by consuming now and not investing in productive capital. Opportunity cost is equal to the potential return on investment of resources used to an alternate end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems dynamics models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-opportunity analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen standard assumptions of welfare economics and CBA are met, optimisation models can play an important role in analysing the potential impact of policies or projects on the allocation of existing economic resources. Where assumptions for welfare economics CBA are not met however, models should be selected which don’t impose the existence of economic equilibrium, that incoporate heterogeneous actors and that represent system dynamics rather than calculate outcomes at moments in time e.g. agent-based models, system dynamics models and non-equilibrium macro-econometric models.\nSharpe et al.(2021) also recommend the use of ‘risk opportunity analysis’ (ROA) which is a more general form of cost-benefit analysis. ROA steps involve:\n\nSystem boundaries are delimited, and all relevant interactions and positive and negative feedbacks are identified; (suitable models, if required, are chosen or designed);\nThe potential effects (intended and unintended) of policy options in the economy are assessed, and uncertainty ranges estimated;\n\nMapping the relationships between components of the economic system of concern, in terms of reinforcing and balancing feedbacks\nIdentifying the likely effect of policy interventions on system behaviour, based on changes to the structure of relationships between components (including relationships created by other policies that already exist or are under consideration). This may be extended to include the creation of a range of scenarios and storylines of cumulative causation that result from policy action, where longer-term effects are likely to be important to policy objectives;\nComparing likely effects in terms of:\n\nDirection of change (of any variables of policy interest)\nMagnitude of change (which may or may not be quantifiable)\nPace of change\nPossible accumulation of risk and opportunity (option generation)\nConfidence, or range of uncertainty, in each of i to iv above.\n\n\nThe risks and opportunities of options (including most likely, best-case and worst-case outcomes) are compared along multiple relevant metrics and dimensions (where probabilities may be quantifiable or unquantifiable). This includes consideration of systemic risk (breakdown of an existing system), and systemic opportunity (where policy generates a whole new system, or set of opportunities);\nThe preferred option is determined by the decision-maker based on a qualitative judgment of the scale of the opportunities and risks, compared to the cost of the intervention. This will necessarily be a subjective judgment (since it incorporates a weighing of outcomes in different dimensions), informed by an objective assessment of likelihood and magnitude of possible outcomes in each of the relevant dimensions; and\nA clear statement of the reasoning behind the decision is recorded including the decisionmaking body’s assessment of the risks and opportunities in their various dimensions. (This can be helpful for transparency and for learning from experience).\n\nKey differences in ROA to CBA are that multiple metrics are used, the focus is on expected processes that drive change rather than outcomes, unquantified risks and opportunities are central to consideration so expected values are not used, policy should aim for maximum leverage in the desired direction of change and interventions should be enough to generate self-reinforcing change in desired direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiregional input-output analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCarthy, Dellink and Bibas (2018) identify two broad approaches in the literature for ex ante modelling of the potential economic implications of greater resource efficiency delivered through a more circular economy: \n\n‘Accounting modelling’ approaches: These generally involve developing scenarios in one or more sectors (with changes often modelled autonomously of policies) and drawing on expert opinion to estimate potential economic impacts in the form of costs savings or job creation. In some cases, input-output tables or multipliers are used to estimate indirect effects from changes in demand and production structures. A key benefit of this approach is the transparency of modelling, while a perceived drawback is not incorporating the influence of relative price changes and how households and firms may react to these through time nor the complexity of transitions around interactions between drivers as well as second-order feedback effects.\n‘Macroeconomic modelling’ approaches: These approaches encompass economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) or macroeconometric models. CGE models use mathematic equations to represent optimisation of households and firms in line with general equilibrium theory, while econometric time series models are based on econometrically estimated dynamics allowing disequilibrium effects and bounded rationality to be accounted for. A key benefit of CGE and macroeconometric models is their more explicit incorporation of the role that prices may play in determining supply and demand. A perceived weakness with CGE models is the restrictive assumptions which can underpin them, while for macroeconometric models, there is an argument that the assumption of historical behaviour guiding future economic interactions may be misplaced when dealing with ‘out of sample’ changes in the economy.\n\n\nInput-output models\nTo study the economy-wide implications of applying material efficiency on emissions, employment, domestic value added and resource use, input-output models have been used, either at the level of individual economies (Scott et al., 2019), or for the global economy (Donati et al., 2020; Wiebe et al., 2019). Input-output data is collected by countries in accordance with the System for National Accounts in a relatively consistent way and can therefore be compiled in databases called multi-regional input-output (MRIO) databases. Input-output models (IOMs) describe the structure of the economy and the interdependencies between sectors. For each economic sector, these models contain, in an aggregated and monetary presentation, goods that are needed (the inputs) across sectors and the goods that are produced (the outputs). By linking all in- and outputs to sectors or final demand, an economy-wide ‘transaction’ overview is provided. The models typically contain information about output, income of households, jobs and added value while environmental extensions can also be added. Hernendez et al. (2018) in a review of publications analysing circularity interventions through Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Modelling (EE-IOM) found approaches to modelling changes in residual waste management, closing supply chains, product lifetime extension and resource efficiency using IOA:\n‘Our findings show that residual waste management can be modelled by increasing the amount of waste flows absorbed by the waste treatment sector. Closing supply chains can be modelled by adjusting input and output coefficients to reuse and recycling activities and specifying such actions in the EEIOA model if they are not explicitly presented. Product lifetime extension can be modelled by combining an adapted final demand with adjusted input coefficients in production. The impacts of resource efficiency can be modelled by lowering input coefficients for a given output’\nTo assess the wider economic impact of policies through IOMs beyond sectors immediately affected, IO multipliers can be used. Changes driven by policies may be associated with the creation of new jobs or revenues in one sector directly, but also induce additional jobs in sectors supply goods to that sector (indirect impact). These effects may serve to induce new final demand, further delivering economic growth/change to the economy (induced impact). Assumptions underpinning multipliers need to be accounted for: 1) Firms in an economic sector are often diverse and changes in the economy linked to resource efficiency interventions may result in new business models with different inputs and outputs. In such cases, available multipliers may misjudge the impact of activities; 2) input-output multipliers assume fixed input coefficients in production and therefore price changes of production inputs will not induce changes in the relative share of different inputs for production; 3) multipliers do not take factor markets into account such that a sector can grow without incorporating crowding-out effects of additional demand. For instance, additional jobs from new investment may lead to crowding-out effects resulting in higher wages throughout the economy which may restrain the initial economic impact. As a result, IO multipliers can overestimate impacts of changes. The general limiting factor for IO approaches is that they don’t effectively account for changes in relative prices that interventions stimulate and how firms and households react to these. Applications include:\n\nBarrett et al. (2009) assessed the possible impacts of 13 resource efficiency strategies on reducing emission to 2020.\nScott et al. (2019) analysed at the level of the UK using input-output models\nNorman et al. (2021)\nWiebe et al. (2019) utilise MRIO analysis models for their ability to support analysis within a context of industry interdependencies, within and between countries, intermediate and final demand and producers and consumers. Project EXIOBASE at a global level to 2030 based on exogenous parameters included in the IEA Energy Technology Perspective’s 6-degree scenario, comparing this reference scenario to a circular economy scenario associated with more recycling, material efficiency increases, repair and reuse and assessing impacts on material extraction, employment and value added per sector. Find global material extraction fell by about 10% compared to the baseline with a small positive impact on employment.\n\n\n\nComputable General Equilibrium Models\nComputable general equilibrium (CGE) models are a class of economic models that combine use of input-output data with the application of microeconomic theory. CGE models can be statistic i.e. assuming changes happen instantly or dynamic through assuming some elements are sticky and take time to materialise. The mathematic approach of CGE models can allow flexibility in modelling production curves and consumption behaviour as the explicit incorporation of prices in determining demand and supply for products and materials is a key advantage over expert judgement and IO approaches. Grounded in general equilibrium theory, a limiting factor of CGE models is argued by some to be their assumptions of perfect competition in markets and that all markets clear, meaning for instance, that there is no unemployment. Applications include:\n\nBohringer and Rutherford (2015) developed a multi-regional CGE model for the Ellen MacArthur foundation (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, 2015) with a specific focus on the circular economy. They state the importance of a global model to ensure important spill-over and feedback effects are fully captured and the model of the world is split into 5 regions (EU, North America, Other OECD, China and ROW) which each having 16 economic sectors. The model focuses in detail on transport, energy, households and food, and therefore it omits some areas in more detail (e.g. electricity generation technologies) and specifically there is almost no representation of other minerals and materials except with the construction sector and motor vehicles. Analysis results show GDP could be 11% higher in 2030 and 20% higher in 2050 than the baseline development scenario in a move towards a more circular economy. \nUsing the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model, Bibas, Chateau and Lanszi (2021) assessed the global economic and environmental impacts of fiscal reform consisting of taxes on primary metal and mineral resources and the circulation of revenues to finance subsidies to recycled goods and secondary metal production. They found this would deliver a relative decoupling of primary material use from economic growth to 2040, with a reduction of 7% in metallic and non-metallic minerals compared to the baseline scenario alongside negligible effect on global GDP (loss of 0.2% global GDP in 2040). Regional disparities were identified, depends on whether countries were net importers or exporters of raw materials, available production technologies and input costs of primary and secondary materials. Modelled tax rates are assumed to rise linearly to their target level between 2018-40.\n\n\n\nMacro-Econometric Models\nEconometric time series models are not based upon general equilibrium assumptions but instead consist of econometrically estimated behavioural relationships from outturn data which can consider short-and-medium-term economic impacts of various actors’ decisions while capturing disequilibrium effects and bounded rationality as behaviour in the past was not necessarily rational. Time lags between changes in industrial activity and household activity can also be accounted for based on this approach. Econometric approaches are not robust to the Lucas critique that behaviour in the past may not be relevant for future behaviour because expectations of economic actors may change with the introduction of new policy as ex ante analysis of resource efficiency policies are effectively ‘out of sample’. Transitions generally need structural changes in the incentives and behaviour of economic actors furthermore. Applications include:\n\nThe E3ME model was used in the CE and BioIS (2014) analysis for the European Commission examining scenarios of different resource productivity improvements to show under which conditions resource productivity increases can be achieved in the EU with positive macroeconomic impacts. Improvements in RP under each scenario assumed to come a third each from publicly funded investments in capital stock, privately funded business measures and MBIs. Pre-analysis undertaken to calculate abatement cost for each ‘user’ of each material using each policy type (MBI, regulation and investment). Scenarios considered in terms of impact of GDP (net benefits or net costs) and jobs.\nThe CCC’s 6th Carbon Budget focussed on measures while recognising Net Zero will be a policy-led transition. Initially undertook a microeconomic analyses stage estimating required capital investment for these measures based upon assumptions of costs for key technologies and how these might change into the future under different scenarios. Also accounted for operating costs, which represent the additional costs or savings of running the low-carbon solutions once they have been deployed relative to the cost of the high-carbon options they replace. Building on the estimates of annualised resource costs from the micro-level analysis, commissioned CE to analyse the macroeconomic implications of introducing recommended pathway against baseline using E3ME in terms of GDP change (relevant to this piece of legislation because under the original Climate Change Act, possibly a requirement that transition costs should not exceed a certain % of GDP).\n\nTo provide transparency of assumptions and consistency in modelling across material impacts and macroeconomic effects, we represent interventions as blueprints which indicate where and how changes are to be applied in the input-output tables which feed into both the EE-MRIO system and macroeconomic analysis to simulate the possible impacts of policy interventions on RMC and emissions. Generic assumptions are made about the likely efficacy and characteristics of different types of policies, though where possible, sector-specific information is incorporated to improve on these generalisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Modelling use-phase optimisation in input-output tables\n\n\n\n\n\nA range of policy approaches might be introduced to extend the lifespans of products, each with different characteristics and varying in their potential applicability given circumstances. For instance, regulatory standards might be levied on producers which require minimum product lifespans (e.g. in terms of minimum number of cycles) or the use of components, materials or production techniques that could support more durable or repairable products. Alternatively, consumption-focussed approaches might involve providing information to consumers about product lifespans via eco-labels in order to overcome information asymmetries and enable more green consumption. Additional approaches might include alterations to the VAT system to attempt to further incentivise repair over replacement. The effectiveness of these policies in extending product lifetimes will depend on the characteristics of the policy, technological conditions, reasons for lifespans being shorter than otherwise possible for the products in scope and on mediating factors for some policies such as the responsiveness of consumers to labels or the degree to which incentivisation via charge or price instruments might alter the costs of one activity in relation to another.\nApproaches to model this value driver in input-output tables include:\n\nMcCarthy, Dellink and Bibas (2018) set out two ways in which delayed product replacement is frequently modelled within macroeconomic assessments of the circular economy. The first is through decreasing the monetary volume of demand for the hypothetical longer-lived product, thereby lowering sale values and revenue to the producing sector. An alternative approach makes the assumption that products with longer lifespans are sold at higher prices by producers, such that the policy has no noticeable direct effect on the economy in monetary terms notwithstanding reduced material demand.\nDonati et al. (2020) set out approaches to simulating product lifetime extension in MRIO via two routes. For delayed product replacement, they suggest reducing transactions of new products (or components) and adjusting input coefficients in production to reflect increased product durability (also identified as an approach used in the literature by Aguilla-Hernendez et al. (2018). For lifetime extension via greater reuse and remanufacturing, they alternatively propose modelling this as a reduction in transactions of new products alongside increased spending on ancillary activities related to maintenance and repair services (see diagram below for the associated modelling blueprints they use for these interventions and their paper for additional blueprints).\nNorman et al. (2021) model product lifetime extension through reducing expenditure by firms in relevant intermediate sectors alongside reductions in final expenditure by household and governments while addressing macro-economic rebounds by increasing the size of the domestic repair economy."

    "text": "Wider business ecosystem stakeholders\nWider business ecosystem stakeholders (ES) such as government bodies, non-governmental organisations and academia can in various ways shape and parameterise the landscape in which value-chain-activities occur.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Central government\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 80% of UK business leaders surveyed in a 2022 poll agreed that government policies are required to bring about the economy-wide changes needed to tackle climate change, as a closely linked issue (CISL, 2022). Regulation is often thought about solely as control by a government furthermore, with the OECD (2021) defining regulation as ’instruments by which governments set requirements on enterprises and citizens’. Given their responsibilities and resources, primary avenues of influence available to central governments across the UK include:\n\nthe ability to issue legislative and policy instruments prescribing or prohibiting certain behaviours;\nfinancial and other resources which can be distributed or redistributed to enable activities to be undertaken;\nthe means to collate and generated information by being in the centre of knowledge networks; and\nthe capacity to create organisations conducting activities such as public bodies or committees (Steurer, 2013; Duit, 2016).\n\nWhile the UK Government is the central executive authority of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, since the 1990s many areas of law and policy-making relating to waste and resource management have become devolved across the countries making up the UK. This means that central government departments with jurisdictions relating to the circular economy exist not only in the UK Government but too the Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive, though devolution has been asymmetrical in the powers devolved across these bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Local authorities and cities\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of local government varies by country in the UK, with N. Ireland, Scotland and Wales having a single level of local government bodies, while in England there is a combination of single-tier authorities in some areas and two-tiers of local government in others (OECD, 2022). Local authorities (LA) across the UK (referred to as local councils in N. Ireland) have statutory responsibility for council services including the collection and treatment of local-authority collected waste (LACW) and street sweepings (Rezaie et al. 2022).\nHistorically, LAs organised as either individual or combined waste collection and/or disposal authorities have had localised discretion over budgetary allocations for waste management, which materials are collected, how frequently and treatment arrangements (Abbott et al. 2011). The 2021 Environment Bill provides Defra the legal power to mandate improved consistency of recycling collections across LAs in England alongside cost-sharing mechanisms through EPR as part of its major waste reforms, with similar proposals in Scotland and Wales.\nIn addition to potentially altering council services for which they are responsible to drive a more circular economy, LAs as well as regional bodies and cities can help provide other enabling conditions for a CE transition (Figure 3) (EMF, 2019). This includes through setting ambition and direction (e.g. the West Midlands’ Circular Economy Routemap), community engagement, financial resource allocation, advice and in-kind support (e.g. ReLondon’s Business Transformation programme), planning, the management of public assets and as a purchaser of goods and services.\nReports submitted by signatories to the Circular Cities Declaration show key trends including growing national and supra-national support to cities, the adoption of circular strategies and roadmaps to steer the transition (Abu-Bakar, 2023), investment in infrastructure, using public procurement to achieve objectives, establishing innovation programmes and projects, raising awareness and empowering citizens along with particular focuses on the construction and food sectors (CCD, 2023).\n\n\nFigure 3. Urban policy levers for circular economy transitions (EMF, 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Non-governmental organisations and civil society\n\n\n\n\n\nThrough growth in opportunities for participation in the policy-making process (Bäckstrand, 2005) and outside of it, civil society actors have acquired greater status in the landscape of environmental regulation (OECD, 2022). ‘Civil society’ broadly refers to stakeholders (interacting as) neither the government nor market and which includes the general public and those organised. Citizens in the liberal democracy of the UK can influence outcomes through participation in the voting and wider political process. Organised, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) perform a variety of regulatory and steering functions that include:\n\nInputting to agenda-setting and policy formulation via government facilitated routes of engagement such as consultations and too outside of these;\nCollecting, analysing and disseminating information e.g. to monitor compliance;\nCoordinating with other actors e.g. the Circular Economy Task Force convened by the Green Alliance which sought to broker greater collaboration within sectors, improve product design and company reporting (Oswald et al. 2018; BITC, 2023);\nPressurising firms and the government (such as through organising boycotts or legal routes e.g. client earth) and whistle-blowing; and\nDeveloping localised schemes (Maitre-Ekern and Dalhammar, 2019).\n\nIn addition, NGO influence has increasingly taken new forms such as establishing unilateral partnerships with firms and creating, promulgating and monitoring formalised standards e.g. the EMF’s ‘Circulytics’ monitoring system (Steurer, 2013). In many cases, this has arisen through the need to fill regulatory gaps emerging e.g. at the international level, such as the Forest Stewardship Council - a multi-stakeholder voluntary third-party mechanism covering global wood production chains (Klooster, 2010). Particularly prominent NGOs in this area include those more closely tied to government bodies in the UK such as Wrap and Zero Waste Scotland as well as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Circle Economy, the Green Alliance and Business in the Community. Philanthropic groups which blur the line between public and private can too be active.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Intergovernmental bodies\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral intergovernmental bodies have taken key positions in facilitating countries to tackle environmental pressures from human activities. For instance, the United Nations’ (UN) environmental programme (UNEP) has played a role in coordinating international scientific advisory bodies such as the IPCC, organising international conferences, and establishing international frameworks for climate change mitigation and adaptation, desertification and biodiversity. UNEP also has an important role in brokering information (e.g. the Global Material Flows database) and wider thought leadership.\nA particular active supranational body in the area of CE is the World Economic Forum (WEF), with programmes developed including the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE) that works to develop commitments towards the circular economy via a range of value-chain partnerships (Circle Economy, 2022). Other international bodies such as the World Bank are increasingly active in this area through the production of reports and other outputs (WB, 2022). Many other international agencies and organisations covering finance, shipping, energy and food production have the potential to contribute to more circular and sustainable practices via their own routes of influence. At a regional level, the UNECE is leading on many circular economy issues such as relating to data and value chain mapping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Academia\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademic researchers and research programmes contribute to, among other things, the ability to evaluate and evidence the benefits, costs and risks of different CE options, including at the direct request of government policy-makers. Examples of such organisations include the UKRI NICER Programme and Circ-NSR project."

BSI standards are typically broad in nature (covering e.g. principles and terminology) and for use by technical committees or actors when producing their own horizontal, generic or product-specific standards. Examples of BSI standards relevant to the circular economy include:\n\nBS EN 45552:2020 - General method for the assessment of the durability of energy-related products;\nBS EN 45555:2019 - General methods for assessing the recyclability and recoverability of energy-related products; and\nBS EN IEC 62474:2019 - Material declaration for products of and for the electrotechnical industry.\n\nThe widely used ISO family of industry-based environmental management standards have also been extended to include circular economy guidance such as:\n\nISO 14009  - Guidelines for incorporating material circulation in design and development; and\nISO 59020 - Circular economy — Measuring circularity framework\n\nThis also reflects ISO’s commitment to climate action as set out in its 2021 London Declaration. ISO and BSI standards are voluntarily adopted, maintained by private organisations but accepted by public actors which adds to their perceived legitimacy (Falkner, 2003). ISO certificates have been found to be largely concentrated in higher-income countries (To and Lee, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Technology providers\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology providers may work to fill new markets generated by government regulation or proactively offer a technology solution to core market actors and those throughout the business ecosystem. This can be in anticipation of future government regulation or not. Examples of relevant technology providers include those working in the area of data such as SAP and Topolytics, who offer products to support improved material tracing and internal accounting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Finance sector\n\n\n\n\n\nThere exist potential financial risks associated with poor environmental performance for firms using equity financing, commercial financing or income generation through the sale of bonds as investor cost of capital may increase for firms perceived as irresponsible. This risk may have grown in recent years in a context of third sector organisations encouraging shareholder action and fiduciary duty dynamics become of wider importance. Public equity, private market funds and wider debt and equity instruments can enable the development of CE activities (Mahönën, 2019). Investor action on the circular economy is relatively nascent, but as with climate considerations, may be expected to come in the form of commitments and policies or the uptake of metrics and ESG criteria (UN PRI, 2022). Central banks and wider financial supervisory bodies from international to national scales can contribute to aligning the financial sector with societal objectives given their uniquely close links to capital markets (Couto, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\nOther relevant actors in the extended enterprise network include certification bodies, ratings agencies and wider service suppliers including in the insurance sector (Swiss Re, 2023)."

Examples at the firm level include applying ESG Criteria, strategies or demands between firms for certain practices. An examples at the industry level is the Sustainable Forestry Initiative.1 There are a range of motivations internal to firms which might encourage improved environmental performance in the absence of overt government regulation (Porter and van der Linde, 1995; Ambec and Lanoie, 2008):\n\nReducing resource and waste-related production costs and minimising future liabilities/supply chain risks;\nDifferentiation advantages through business model development and entry into new markets;\nBuilding corporate imagery and brand integrity;\nNavigating conditions on access to inputs such as capital or the sale of outputs linked to purchaser expectations;\nHelping manage supply or demand-side risks;\nFactors around organisational culture and normative drivers.\n\nShifts in business models can be thought about as being: 1) philanthropic; 2) integrative (though incorporating more responsible behaviours into current practices); or 3) innovative (though the development of new business models to solve issues) (Halme and Laurila, 2008).\nExamples of resource-efficient business models are set out below (Wrap, 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nService systems\nProviding a service based upon delivering performance outputs that are linked to products or services. Products could also be designed for disassembly, re-manufacture and re-use.\n\n\nHire and leasing\nLong-term hire and leasing of products can deliver a longer term approach to product durability, with longer service life, lower maintenance load and lower use of materials and CO2.\n\n\nIncentivised returns and re-use\nEncourages customers to return used items for an agreed value. Customers gain value for unwanted items and return products via a convenient system. Collected products are refurbished and sold for re-use on appropriate markets.\n\n\nLong life\nProducts are designed to have a long life time with durability, reducing consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Retailers\n\n\n\n\n\nRetailers act as the interface between producers and consumers, influencing demand for goods and services and how they are delivered. Retailers are therefore subject to a range of pressures to drive change, with growing environmental awareness, stakeholder pressures and government rules and regulations reportedly encouraging UK retailers to embrace circular business models in their operations (Upadhyay, Kumar & Akter, 2021). They can also influence post-consumption phases through the adoption and promotion of business models other than a traditional sales-ownership transaction. Various forms of pre-competitive collaboration can be seen among these actors such as the ‘Retailer Net-Zero Collaborative Action Plan’ to align carbon accounting approaches facilitated by Wrap and WWF (George, 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Households\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to influencing value-chain activities as citizens through advocacy or reputation shaming, households can also drive change through their consumption behaviours (Newell, 2008). For instance, consumers may: move patronage to a retailer who offers refillable solutions; purchase second-hand or remanufactured goods; or buy products less often and seek out repair opportunities for currently held goods instead. The responsiveness of consumers is a key determinant of the effectiveness of interventions such as mandatory information disclosure via labelling. Beneficial household behaviour change can be categorised into:\n\nAvoid unecessary consumption or impactful behaviour e.g. reducing food waste;\nShift consumption activities to less environmentally impactful alternatives e.g. sharing instead of buying new; and\nImprove environmental performance of activity in question e.g. using BEVs instead of ICEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Waste management companies\n\n\n\n\n\nWaste management companies are a key group who manage and coordinate the collection, processing and disposal of products and materials from different economic sectors and households, frequently on behalf of LAs. They do so as private entities ranging from small-medium enterprises (SMEs) to multinational corporations, for whom the need to generate profit including via markets for secondary materials, drives investment and interest in public and private sector contracts.\nRecycling, waste and wastewater activities generated a gross value added (GVA) of £16 billion in the UK in 2019 and were associated with 158,000 FTE job roles (ONS, 2022). Data on the flows of wastes as held by many of these companies form a key building block for understanding the quantity, quality, spatial distribution and disposal pathways for products and materials of interest."

For instance, network modes may portray the public as environmental citizens whereas market-based modes cast the public as consumers. Hysing (2009) distinguishes between government as an actor and government as a form of steering, recognising the growing number of ways governments seeks to bring about change - including as a purchaser, delegator, convener and promoter (Sørensen, 2006).↩︎\nThe scale (geographical, but too institution, extent to which an actor can exert influence, varies too by actor) actors can act at defines their capacity for influence across different activities, while the applicability of different types of regulation also differs by scale e.g., there is a low potential for binding rules at the supranational level.↩︎\nCo-regulation is an umbrella term for co-operative forms of regulation in which actors across societal domains interact, hybridise or orchestrate one another to produce governance arrangements (Steurer, 2013; Abbott and Snidal, 2008). Forms of co-regulation between these actors can be defined in the following terms: 1) Private governance between market and civil society actors; 2) Market governance between governments and businesses; 3) Civil society governance between governments and NGOs; and 4) Network governance between the three. As well as active engagement between actors, more tacit approaches such as empowering actors to behave as quasi-regulators can be seen. For instance, mandated information disclosure by the state coupled with data made accessible to voluntary groups on online portals for use to monitor and evaluate.↩︎"

Altering the WEEE Directive's current 'collective producer responsibility' approach by modulating responsibility according to criteria of good design (as a proxy for end-of-life treatment) might make the tool a more effective driver of eco-design.\n2012 review by the Individual Producer Responsibility Working Group into introduction of individual producer responsibility in the UK recommends: drivers of eco-design are strengthened when individual producers are made directly responsible for total end-of-life costs, however reverse logistics of producers collecting their own waste is viewed as impractical. Therefore modulating fees can be an effective middle-ground.\nWhile administrative data shows that the WEEE Regulations have helped enshrine the polluter pays principle, evidence of the impacts on product design is mixed (Kautto, 2006; Yu, Hills and Welford, 2008). Gottberg et al. (2006) - Used a literature review to develop analytical framework to explain the relationship between drivers for eco-design and the role of policies promoting EPR under the WEEE Directive (2002/96/EC). Applied framework to 8 case studies of firms from the European lighting sector. Though based on little quantitative data, which data they had seemed to suggest EPR had little effect on product development up to then as producers had been able to pass on incremental costs associated with EPR to customers with negligible effects on sales (as demand is relatively inelastic, perhaps given current prices, and given that EPR applies to all producers equally). EPR deemed unlikely to drive eco-design in the short run. Found other policies such as bans on hazardous substances, product declarations and supply chain pressures were often more effective promoters of eco-design and that a mix of policy measures required vs. reliance on economic instruments alone.\nEPR fee modulation is an emerging approach (Laubinger et al. 2021)."

While government plans to alter the WEEE Regulations through modulating fees according to criteria of good design could contribute to making the tool a more effective driver of eco-design, it is unclear at this point if the financial incentives this gives alone will be sufficient to drive the design changes needed for longer lifespans of new products (Milios, 2018; Kunz et al. 2014).

The net effects of trade liberalisation on resource use and waste production can be seen as a function of (Grossman and Krueger, 1993; Princen, 2002): 1) Scale effects - impacts due to growing scale of production and consumption; 2) Consumption effects - impacts of changes in the type and location of production and consumption; 3) Technique effects - impacts of changes in the environmental intensity of production; and 4) Governance effects - changes in governance associated with the trade liberalisation.\nAssessments of the impact of new trade agreements following the UK’s EU exit anticipate increases in trade will have knock on effects for resources and waste. For instance, all modelled scenarios of the UK-Australia trade agreement signed in 2021 and to be effective from 2023, point to an increase in output for both countries along with increased resource use - water, land and raw materials, and production of waste (DIT, 2021).

Prices can be a function of not only demand and supply dynamics but also government regulation. Price and market-based instruments (PMBIs) seek to incentivise outcomes by directly affecting payoff structures via the price system (Stavins, 2001). This is often framed in terms of internalising ‘externalities’ i.e. environmental costs not already captured in market prices (Pigou, 1920; Coase, 1960). \nA variety of proposals have been applied and put forward to better leverage price-based instruments for circular economy aims. Taxation on certain disposal routes, non-recycled content and reduced VAT, business rates and National Insurance contributions for activities such as maintenance and repair are examples.

This can occur through: 1) reducing the use of resource inputs into production and consumption processes; and 2) driving input substitution away from primary materials towards those secondary (Government Office for Science, 2014).\nThe UK Aggregates Levy introduced in 2002 had the dual aim of reducing the negative environmental impacts of quarrying and increasing the recycling rate of construction materials by making the costs of virgin material inputs more costly and tax-free recycled aggregates more financially attractive (Ettlinger, 2022).8 Between 2002 and 2018, total aggregation consumption has fallen while the share of aggregates from secondary sources increased (MPA, 2019). An absolute decoupling of industry output from material input has been seen. However, these impacts are difficult to attribute to the levy alone (Ettlinger 2022), with secondary aggregate consumption on an upward trend prior to the introduction of the Levy, and potentially also linked to the Landfill Tax (introduced in 1996) which encouraged the creation of secondary markets.\nMore widely, a 2011 meta-study of virgin material taxation schemes found these reduced the domestic supply of virgin materials and increased demand for recycled products, but often only led to limited use of recycled materials as virgin materials could be sourced overseas (Söderholm, 2011).\nRecycled and secondary materials in total aggregates sales in Great Britain (Million tonnes) (MPA, 20 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 0.35% of the UK’s landmass is covered by planing permission for mineral development - including extraction sites, processing plants, minerals waste tips and landscaping schemes.

    "text": "Efficiency\nIf properly designed and implemented, market based instruments can theoretically help achieve a desired level of environmental use at the lowest overall cost to society and with dynamic incentives to bring down abatement costs over time (Pearce, 2002; Johnson, 1999). Based on the rational polluter hypothesis, PMBIs work by eliminating the difference between private and socially efficient prices thereby inducing polluters to behave as if pollution costs entered their private cost functions and encouraging movement towards a more socially efficient aggregate level of environmental use. This is done through polluters with lower MACs undertaking more abatement than those with higher MACs (Goulder and Parry 2008).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxes increase costs of products and activities in a predictable manner, making it easier to judge first round financial impact on consumers and firms (OECD 2011). Tradable permits: high degree of potential cost uncertainty because the aggregate cost of compliance is based on the future price of permits which can be difficult to predict.\nAchieve allocatively efficient outcome at least cost: This will also be realised at the lowest overall cost to society because: 1) assumng market participants have knowledge of their own MACs, can be incentivised to reduce environmental consumption/pollution until the cost of abating an additional unit of use equals the marginal benefit of reducing use in terms of avoided tax payments (Baumol & Oates, 1971); 2) polluters with lower marginal abatement cost-curves (MACs) i.e. who can abate most cheaply, will undertake more abatement than those with higher MAC curves (in line with the equimarginal principle) - the efficiency benefits of which increase with MAC heterogeneity (Fiorino, 2004); and 3) taxees are given flexibility as to how they reduce their costs across abatement channels and facilities.\nSecondly, the tax that is accrued can be used to offset distortionary taxes such as income tax. Distortionary taxes are those that cause a deviation from allocative efficiency. Heavier taxation of virgin materials and a reduced taxation of labour can contribute to changes in relative factor prices which will better reflect the social value of resources, without increasing overall costs – improving market efficiency. The Ex’tax Project argues that “High taxes on labour encourage businesses to minimise their number of employees. Resources, however, tend to be untaxed; they are used unrestrained. This system causes unemployment, overconsumption and pollution”.

For markets, there is a high degree of potential cost uncertainty because the aggregate cost of compliance as based on the future price of permits is difficult to predict. Cost effectiveness depends more on the extent of pricing and design of the instrument than whether a tax or C&T is used.\nGoulder (2013) finds cap & trade e.g. the SO2 trading scheme under the Clean Air Act and SO2 and NOx trading in LA under RECLAIM, brought significant cost reductions relative to conventional regulatory approaches.\nCharge-rebate schemes may be associated with high transaction costs and markets for recycled products may not be well developed without accompanying instruments e.g. a minimum recycled-content law.\nWelsh Government (2016) Post Implementation review of the single use carrier bag charge in Wales - SUCB just 13% of eligible firms said that it had had a negative impact on their business."

    "text": "Affordability and feasibility\nThe UK government raises over £820 billion a year in receipts. The majority are from three main sources: income tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) and value added tax (VAT) which together raise over £470 billion.\nGovernment revenue from environmental taxes in the UK, 1997 to 2021 (ONS, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMBIs still rely on laws being introduced\nSome of these instruments can generate tax revenues.\nAn optimal level of environmental use arises when societal welfare is maximised in relation to environmental quality or in other words, where the NPV of marginal abatement benefits equals that of marginal abatement costs. Optimal pricing has high information requirements however due mainly to uncertainty in the marginal social damage curve, leading regulators to generally seek acceptable or improved rather than optimal levels (Pearce and Turner, 1990).\nOptimal pricing has a high informational requirements due mainly to uncertainty in the marginal social damage curve, while setting a rate that exactly compensates for those externalities can be difficult, so regulators therefore generally seek to achieve acceptable vs. optimal levels (Pearce and Turner 1990). ‘Acceptable pricing’ may be necessary when outside of the theoretic ideal of rational choice and maximizing frameworks, and rather being within a bounded rationality and satisfying framework. While still depending on the responsiveness of regulatees to a tax, this more pragmatic approach makes the level of acceptable pollution no longer a question purely within the domain of economics, but of environmental and social considerations too (Baumol and Oates,).\nGovernment - Exchequer impact including operational impacts\n\nReductions in the current tax regime such as on VAT, capital allowances and too subsidies are generally least preferred options by government tax authorities due to reductions in tax receipts and costs to government. Growing requests for VAT relief, and anticipate working through the VAT system might not work. Business rates reduction also not viewed as likely very effective of an approach for increasing repair activity by Treasury.\nCarbon taxes in N. America seem most viable when a party leader is personally strongly committed, their party holds a majority in parliamentary system so it can’t become a politically adversarial issue, the measures can be passed between elections and the party can deflect attention from the issue in the next election (Harrison, 2012).\n\nTax more desirable than subsidies for not drawing on government budgets and rather raising revenues, while being less prescriptive technologically.\nAdministrative costs - Enforcement and compliance, a potential advantage of permits is the increase of incentives for pollution sources to identify themselves in order to claim their permits.\nLesser Regulatory Burden: PMBIs can generate administrative savings in time and money by devolving management decisions from regulators to private decision makers who are better aware of their own abatement costs (Baumol and Oates, 1971; Stavins, 1998). For permits, a benefit is that there is an increased incentive for pollution sources to identify themselves in order to claim their permits in the event of grandfathering.\nGovernmental Benefits: 1) Revenue Generation: An environmental tax and auctioned permits not only has the effect of incentivizing less impactful behaviour, but also raises money that can be used in part to: 1) finance a clean-up of ‘dirty’ activities; or 2) offset distortionary taxes producing a first order efficiency gain, though this can be counteracted by the costs of policy shifting to consumers leading to price level rises, depressing factor supply and resulting efficiency losses) Without revenue recycling furthermore, cap-and-trade might be efficiency reducing. When people do not trust that a carbon price will be sufficient to reduce emissions, they prefer using the carbon price revenue to subsidise low-carbon technologies and research. The state doesn’t collect as much revenue with markets as taxes, though you can auction permits, and do so annually to increase revenues - in practice very few revenues are kept as payments are used to incentivize behaviour and lessen costs of abatement typically; 2) Lesser Regulatory Burden: Market-based instruments can generate administrative savings in time and money by devolving management decisions from regulators to private decision makers and negating otherwise potentially high informational requirements, particularly given that environmental problems are usually characterized by information asymmetries, where agents are aware of their own abatement costs, but the regulator is not. Nevertheless administered markets are generally more resource-consuming than taxes, and both require monitoring which can alter the balance more heavily in favour of C&C. However, a price on emissions invariably affects the type of abatement technologies firms invest in, so that the technological side of emissions abatement must always be considered in tandem with the design of the market-based instrument itself (Calel, 2001). For permits, a benefit is that there is an increased incentive for pollution sources to identify themselves in order to claim their permits.\nThe latest HMRC statistics show that the aggregate levy raised £407m in total receipts in the 2016/17 financial year (a proportion of this has funded the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund managed by Natural England). This has been the largest amount collected. Assuming no change in the amount of aggregates under the obligation, an increase to £2.5/tonne could raise the total HMRC revenue by up to 25% from the current base.\nExtending the use of raw material tax to other materials would significantly raise the tax revenue from the current base but the exact amount depends on the scope and level of the levy.\nRevenue Generation: Taxes and auctioned permits can raise a regular flow of money for the government that can be used to finance remediation of environmental damage, or offset distortionary taxes. Revenue recycliing can play an important role in defining the overall efficiency of PMBIs, including via reducing the cost-ramp of alternative technologies.\nSubsidies present a cost to the government which if funded through general taxation can be economically distortive.\nInformation requirements: Knowledge of both the aggregate MAC and the aggregate MDC is needed for taxes to be set at an efficient level of environmental use, which can present high costs (Cole and Grossman, 2002; Ogus, 2004). Can be difficult to determine the right number of permits to allocate as an underallocation may lead to high costs, and an overallocation can limit the ability to reach a desired level of environmental use. Regulators can use best estimates but carries environmental (e.g. irreversible damage) and economic (e.g. locking firms into technological choices) risks.\nImplementation and monitoring costs: Can require administrative infrastructure for measurement and monitoring which may not be present or may be prohibitively costly. When so, may require proxy pricing. Tradable permits also associated with the costs of establishing a market.\nRegulatory burden: Taxes are more commonly used in governments than administered markets, so costs for this less, while monitoring and enforcement costs likely cheaper, however difficult to set correct tax rates due to high information requirement knowing how consumers/producers would respond to price signals based on their MAC function and price elasticity of demand. Regulators can use best estimates but carries environmental (e.g. irreversible damage) and economic (e.g. locking firms into technological choices) risks (Hanley et al. 1997).\nC&T system can involve greater regulatory burden because there are costs of setting up a market for auctioning and trading allowances and the regulator must not only keep track of emissions of facilities, but also establish a registry to record changes in ownership of allowances as a result of purchases or sales\nPublic:\n\nCan be politically undesirable - consumers often oppose eco-taxes e.g. in France due to increase in hydrocarbon component of sales tax of fuel in November 2018, which was later removed by Macron in December\nThough taxation often disliked, not always the case. Almost half of respondents to a 2020 YouGov survey supported an increase in the charge on plastic bag from 5p to 10p, which was then subsquently implemened (YouGov, 2020).\nPublic resistance to taxes can be overcome by, for instance: earmarking proceeds for other desirable uses; compensating losers using lump-sum transfers; reducing impact to possible losers by using differentiated taxes or other social cushioning measures; using environmental taxes to cut other undesirable taxes; and improving communication and information sharing to make the public feel part of the process (Carattini, Carvalho and Fankhauser, 2018).\n\nBusinesses:\n\nIndustry and trade-unions are likely to resist not only the achievement of the efficient outcome, but also using taxation as an instrument for doing so (because of the additional cost to them).\nMarkets are generally more politically desirable than taxes - less fear government will abuse the system for revenue generation ends, the polluter pays only for the non-optimal portion of total emissions (though not always) and can feel more in control of a permit system (Pearce and Barbier, 2000)."

This can vary in three circumstances: 1) In the presence of rapid rates of economic growth, a fixed tax leads to an increase of aggregate emissions whereas permits can give no allowance to this, but the price of permits increases to account for the enhanced desire for them; 2) In the context of inflation, a unit tax decreases in real terms and so emissions levels increases, whereas with a permit system there is no change in the aggregate; and 3) In the presence of exogenous technological change, a tax system leads to increases in control levels and a decrease in aggregate emissions whilst a permit system maintains emissions with a fall in permit prices.\nCost Certainty: Taxes increase costs of products and activities in a predictable manner, making it easier to judge first round financial impact to consumers and firms (OECD 2011). While traded permits are expected to create a price per-unit of emissions similar to a tax assuming an efficient market, there isn’t so much certainty as to their cost when auctioned.\nThe effectiveness of taxes are contingent on the prices of the taxed good or service (if traded) not going down which would otherwise lessen the effectiveness of prices in signaling change.\nLack of immediacy possible due to complications in the mechanism, leading to stalling R&D in industries with high MACs (and in the long-run a less immediate transition to lower-pollution heavy productions). - Grubb paper\nFor Dynamic Efficiency: Eco-taxes must be high enough and expected to remain in place given costs and uncertain returns of technological efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide continuous incentives for further environmental harm reduction, stimulating technological change because the tax is avoided if pollution is reduced but will depend on the cost profiles of abatement options. Taxes provide an ongoing incentive to reduce pollution emissions/resource use through innovation, commercialization and adoption of technologies, which lower MAC because doing so saves tax expenditures. Administered markets are superior in this effect because of incentive to sell permits too. Calel and Dechezlepretre (2016) found that the EU ETS increased low-carbon innovation by as much as 10% (in the pollution-light firms).\nAdministered markets are superior to taxes in providing ongoing incentives to lessen costs because of the ability to sell permits and not only reduce tax expenses. General economic instruments have been shown to have encouraged diffusion and incremental-type-innovation in the automotive and energy sectors (Bergek and Berggren, 2014).\nThough addressing the environmental externality, prices alone may not address the innovation market failures comprehensively as may pull through sub-optimal technologies, thereby necessitating supply-side technology instruments being introduced alongside (Goulder, 2013).\nPorter (1991) argues for the value of well-designed MBIs as a means of both increasing profit and improving environmental performance by shifting the cost-benefit of these actors, and harnessing competition (Borze and Risse, 2010).\nThough addressing the environmental externality, these do not address the innovation market failures comprehensively, where supply-side technology instruments are needed (Goulder, 2013)."

However this wouldn’t necessarily be the case for a tax such as on gasoline which would be progressive.\nCallan et al. (2009) found a carbon tax of 20 euros/tCO2 with revenue recycling in Ireland was marginally regressive, though if the tax revenue were used to increase social benefits and tax credits, households across the income distribution would be made better off without exhausting the total carbon tax.\nhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w31221\nA lot depends on how tax revenues are recycled.

They found this would deliver a relative decoupling of primary material use from economic growth to 2040, with a reduction of 7% in metallic and non-metallic minerals compared to the baseline scenario alongside negligible effect on global GDP (loss of 0.2% global GDP in 2040). Regional disparities were identified, depends on whether countries were net importers or exporters of raw materials, available production technologies and input costs of primary and secondary materials. Modelled tax rates are assumed to rise linearly to their target level between 2018-40.\nChateau and Mavroeidi (2020) in the study ‘The jobs potential of a transition towards a resource efficient and circular economy’, examined the consequences of a policy-driven transition towards a more resource-efficient and circular economy on employment levels across countries and sectors between 2018-40 using the structural computable general equilibrium model ENV-Linkages. The reallocation of jobs due to a package of fiscal policies was found to be limited, with net job creation globally positive but marginally, at 1.8 million, with high variability between industries and countries. Countries with large extraction sectors were found to see net-job losses, as was the case in sectors depending heavily on primary materials such as construction and some manufacturing sectors, including production of machinery and electronic equipment. Secondary metals and recyclable sectors benefited from large increases in employment. In a scenario in which only OECD countries implemented these policies, employment losses were expected relative to the baseline due to a relative loss of competitiveness.\nDistributional impacts depend on how revenues are recycled e.g. regressive taxes (impacting the poor the hardest as a proportion of income) can be offset by payment to poorest households in the form of welfare receipts.\nsome cross-border impacts have been noted across the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland border, due to the absence of an aggregates or primary materials tax in Ireland. This was partially addressed through the levy credit scheme (ACLS)\nIntroducing a raw material tax might disproportionately affect those sectors that are not able to easily substitute raw materials for secondary materials."

    "text": "Policy complementarities and tradeoffs\nAll policy instruments have strengths and weaknesses and differ in their suitability to leveraging different value drivers across different institutional and industrial groups, while none have the ability to address every aspect of developing a more circular economy on their own. While supply-side measures are important to improve circularity, there is also significant room for demand-side measures. This is often the case even for individual product groups (Wrap, 2023).\nThis implies that policies to support a circular economy are likely to need to be introduced as a mix, levied also at different scales (del Rio and Howlett, 2013; O’Brien and Wilts, 2019). New policies are also not introduced in a vacuum and will interact with existing legislative and regulatory requirements.\n“A resource efficiency policy mix may be developed at the sectoral, sub-sectoral or municipal level in order to address a specific challenge or target, in the context of overarching goals” (O’Brien and Wilts, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy combinations - packaging case example\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of packaging, while the Landfill Tax provides a financial incentive to keep packaging waste out of landfill and an incineration tax could do the same to discourage its incineration, it doesn’t guide waste to any specific alternative treatment. This means that in the absence of additional policy instruments, market conditions including collection costs, material value on the market and treatment costs will otherwise define final treatment routes. On this basis, having in place recycling targets for preferred treatment as part of e.g. the cross-UK packaging extended producer responsibility system can be a helpful counterpart (Defra, 2011), alongside other supply and demand-side measures.\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, when developing a policy response, diversity for diversity’s in instrument sake should be avoided (Gunningham and Graborsky 1998; Gunningham 2009). For instance, a 2007 OECD study found a mix of instruments were not always better than a single one for delivering environmental outcomes efficiently.\nWhere there is a sound basis to introduce policies alongside one another, these will need to be leveraged within a coherent framework across the lifecycle of materials, products and services in addition to the system in which those materials and products operate. Certain instrument mixes may offer greater complementaries than others, such as EPR and taxes, which can be additive in nature. Other examples of complimentary bundles include environmental tax and subsidy reform as well as voluntarism and command and control mechanisms (Gunningham and Sinclair, 1998). Compliance costs in money and time value also need to be kept in mind, with Valpak esimating that the time requirements on firms for reporting under the UK’s plastic packaging tax, EPR and forthcoming deposit return schemes will rise by around 350% compared with current reporting.\nCoherence with the wider policy landscape is also key, particularly with those for delivering ‘net zero’ and industrial strategy (OECD, 2022). This can help maximise regulatory efficiency. Complementarities and conflicts between instruments and broader considerations such as performance against critical success factors and alignment with existing domestic cultural, legal, technological and policy arrangements can be considered to ensure policies do not combine to be less than the sum of their parts (Howlett 2004).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COM-B framework\n\n\n\n\n\nPro-environmental behaviour can be understood as environmentally-significant choices and actions which, directly (goal-directed) or indirectly (incidental), contribute to reductions in environmental impact or enhance the quality of the environment.\nThe COM-B model of behaviour identifies three factors that need to be present for any behaviour to occur: capability, opportunity and motivation (West and Michie, 2020). Drawing on this framing, the tools available to government to drive change can be classified into those that are (Defra, 2018):\n\nAimed at increasing capability to act in the desired way such as through skill or knowledge building;\nAimed at increasing opportunity to act in a desired way e.g. infrastructure provision and grants and loans; and\nTools aimed at increasing motivation to act in desired ways.\n\nAlongside deliberative-engagement approaches based on information provision and more overt attempts to influence behaviour based on formal compulsion and penalties, approaches to altering behaviour, particularly that of citizens and consumers, more subtly through nudging and libertarian paternalism (Thaler and Sunstein, 2003) have become of increasing interest to governments as a means of potentially achieving sought environmental outcomes with lesser levels of required intervention.\nThe COM-B framework is useful for considering how policies may need to be introduced alongside one another to provide all required conditions for change, with the following example provided in the Defra Resoures and Waste Strategy Evidence Annex: “An effective policy will likely include a judicious mix of instruments to create the right set of conditions for desired actions. For example, for businesses to recycle, they must be capable (staff must have the right knowledge, skills and abilities), have the opportunity (have bins and collection systems) and be motivated to do so (have the right incentives in place – financial, regulatory or value-based).”"

For instance, while certain instruments such as taxes might help reach near-term objectives, technology-push policies might need to be introduced concurrently to bring new technologies to the shelf without which more ambitious long-term objectives may not easily be met (Sandén and Azar, 2005).\nDifferent schools of thought exist on best sequencing approaches. ‘Smart regulation principles’ recommend a responsive approach, whereby instrument choice is escalated from combinations including least interventionist approaches to those which involve a higher degree of coercion based on responsiveness of regulatees (Gunningham, 2009). Marginal abatement cost-curve (MACC) approaches also propose starting with policies with least net cost and expanding these out. Criticisms of MACC-based approaches relate primarily to overlooking temporal interdependence between policies. For instance, Grubb and Wieners (2020) illustrate a slow carbon price ramp approach is likely inefficient in the case when carbon abatement costs are shaped by innovation."

    "text": "Policy taxonomy\n\n\n\n\n\nA taxonomy classifies an area on the basis of measurable characteristics (Smith, 2005; Hodgson, 2018). In the area of the circular economy (CE), taxonomies have been developed to classify activities, biophysical flows and indicators for a variety of purposes. As one example, the European Commission (EC) has developed a taxonomy setting out inclusion criteria to help guide investments into circular economy activities (Hirsch and Schempp, 2020).\nWe add to these by presenting a framework and classification of regulatory interventions to drive change towards more circular economies, focussing initially on legal and policy tools available to central and local government actors in the UK. This is intended to help:\n\nGive a structure for building evidence on the current UK and wider policy landscape as it relates to the CE, to examine the effectiveness of already deployed tools through case studies, identify gaps and build an assumption bank for forward-looking modelling of policy impacts; and\nProvide a framework for making consistent recommendations for pathways of interventions to effectively and efficiently move the UK towards a more circular economy.\n\n\nExplore more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy tool profiles\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy tool profiles build off the taxonomy to:\n\nProvide detailed case studies of how policy tools are currently being used in the UK and further afield in support of CE and linked objectives;\nAssess policy tools against a set of criteria or ‘critical success factors’ to synthesise findings regarding tool performance from a range of studies in a structured and consistent way;\nOutline in which contexts and under which conditions tools are likely to be most effective (including accounting for policy interactions);\nProvide guidelines for the ex ante assessment of policy impacts in core appraisal frameworks; and\nMake recommendations for the design and implementation of policy tools.\n\nThis site adds to other reviews of policy instruments available to central and local government actors undertaken by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2015) and Circle Economy (2021) to help explore the most effective and efficient policies and policy packaging for delivery a more circular economy, while providing a UK focus.\n\nExplore more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy briefs\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the taxonomy as a diagnostic tool and the policy tool profiles to aid longlist and shortlist instrument appraisal, the ‘policy briefs’:\n\nLook at barriers and enablers to circular value creation in specific areas in greater depth; and\nProvide recommendations for the adjustment, extension or introduction of policy tools beyond those currently in use to enable the changes/measures identified as necessary by NICER programme centres to realise the benefits of greater circularity across the UK.\n\n\nExplore more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "Scope",
    "text": "Scope\n\nFocus\nWhile the term ‘circular economy’ (CE) has only appeared more recently in policy documents released by UK public bodies, policies whose objectives are congruent with the CE concept by delivering against one of its ‘value drivers’ (see ‘leveraging CE value using policy’), have been introduced in the UK since at least the 1970s.\nWe therefore adopt a broad scope in our review of instruments in order to capture regulations that may not explicitly include reference to the CE, but can otherwise be recognised as relevant. Policies captured in our review therefore include those levied on:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterial flows\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther subdivided into:\n\nPolicies levied on material flows within the economy such as mandated recycling rates or secondary material requirements as well as more widely relating to the quality, quantity or rate of materials, components or products;\nthose applied at the technosphere-ecosphere boundary such as relating to the use of the environment as a material source or sink as with the UK Landfill Tax or UK Aggregates Levy, or fish catch limits;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWider effluents\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch as emissions, which can indirectly leverage CE value drivers or be relevant to objectives more broadly. For instance, fuel economy standards introduced primarily to reduce fuel use have been met to some extent through the lightweighting of vehicles. In other cases, such policies can appear to run counter to CE value drivers in the immediate term, such as increasing the turnover of capital stocks via scrappage schemes to reduce the emissions intensity of the in-use stock.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe natural capital stock\n\n\n\n\n\nsuch as tree-cover targets, which can also be relevant to CE value drivers and linked strategic objectives through routes like increasing the supply of sustainable feedstocks or indirectly driving reductions in the environmental intensity of economic activities; and\n\n\n\n\n\nWe use the following search terms.\n\n\nRegion\nWe prioritise evidence collected on instruments which have been applied in the UK due to institutional and contextual specificities of countries making up the UK. As in some cases, other countries have applied instruments not (yet) used in the UK, evidence from other countries as well as more aggregated meta-evidence for regions including not only the UK are also considered.\nWe identify relevant regulatory instruments from the government legislation portal, retained EU Law dashboard and OECD PINE Database for the period 1970-2022. To capture instruments being delivered outside regulatory systems, we extract information via the google search engine and engage directly with instrument developers such as Wrap.\n\n\nEvidence sources\nEvidence regarding the characteristics and performance of instruments is drawn on from the extant literature, with sources including theoretical modelling studies, surveys, post-implementation reviews, consultations, single policy assessments in scientific papers and meta-analyses. These utilise a range of methods including those quantitative and qualitative methods such as cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and multi-criteria analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodological considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribution - It is unlikely to be the case that all effects on outcomes such as pollution or resource use levels following the introduction of an instrument can be attributed to it. Attribution can be made difficult by the absence of a robust counterfactual i.e. what could have happened were the instrument not introduced. Comparisons of the performance of actors adopting an instrument versus those not can also be impacted by selection bias and other issues of representation. Policy instruments are also rarely used in isolation, such that it is often very difficult to separate individual contributions of policy measures while the joint effects on outcomes need to be recognised.\nTransboundary and cross-media effects - Instruments don’t operate in a national vacuum, and spillover effects which might contribute to environmental degradation elsewhere and including in another environmental media, need to be considered.\nAvailability & quality of information - Ideally our evaluation of instruments should include a comprehensive assessment against all critical success factors, but often due to data and resource constraints, this is not possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe catalogue government plans, strategies, legislation, programmes and projects on which evidence is collected, with instruments coded based on their: medium of focus; material or substance(s) of focus; scale and region to which they are applied e.g. national-level and UK-wide or country region making up the UK; instrument type e.g. a ban or tax; applicable institutional sectors and where leived on industry, associated industry classification codes. Evidence is further flagged based on the region to which it relates."

    "text": "Inputting to the policy cycle\nOutputs of the review are intended to input to the policy development cycle through supporting shortlist and longlist appraisal and informing policy design and implementation. To do so effectively, we translate collated evidence into:\n\nA scoring matrix of policies against critical success factors to inform longlist appraisal;\nA set of modelling blueprints to help provide transparency of assumptions and consistency in ex ante modelling of policy instruments such as takes place during shortlist appraisal (Donati et al. 2020); and\nRecommendations for policy design and implementation, to effectively and efficiently leverage instruments.\n\nAs the suitability of instruments will differ by product group and products, this is intended to be a first port of call in thinking systematically about which policy tools to use when trying to leverage CE value drivers to achieve social objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractions with existing commitments\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many cases, government has commitments in place to realise changes identified as necessary for more circular economies across the UK. For instance, following the 2017 Chief Scientific Advisors Office’s report ‘From Waste to Resource Productivity’ which called for the development of a national strategy to deliver this transition, the Resources and Waste Strategy (RWS) for England published in 2018 by Defra sets out a strategic ambition to double resource productivity and eliminate avoidable waste of all kinds by 2050 in line with the direction of the 25 Year Environment Plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct group\nExisting policy commitments\n\n\n\n\nVehicles\n\nEcodesign principles for the UK automotive sector\nReform to the ELV Regulations\nIntroduce an EPR schemes for Tyres\nWork with BSI to develop quality assurance mark designed to increase confidence in reuse, repaired and remanufactured parts\nSupport work of other government departments to capture data relating to the social and environmental benefits of car-sharing and leasing models\nWork with industry, academia and OGDs to jointly plan for the transition from combustion engines to EVs and effective EV battery management\n\n\n\nPackaging\n\nBan unnecessary plastics (plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds, single-use plates, cutlery and balloon sticks as well as packaging for takeaways);\nDevelop standards for bio-based and biodegradable plastics\nReform packaging waste regulations governing EPR so producers pay full end-of-life clean up cost and set further targets on businesses for packaging recycling\nPlace charges on other single-use plastic items beyond plastic bags; Plastic packaging tax; Increase plastic bag charge to 10p and extend to all shops; Introduce a DRS for single use drinks containers\nSupport campaigns to promote reusable alternatives\nDeliver on the ‘greening government’ commitment by removing single-use packaging from government estates\nFund the £20 million Plastics Innovation fund, the £20 million Plastic and Waste Investment Fund and R&D through Plastics Pact\n\n\n\nConstruction\n\nEcodesign regulation for construction components and materials; Support to LAs to work through planning system to promote sustainable construction\nEPR scheme on selection of construction wastes\nEcolabelling of construction components and materials\nWork with industry to explore shift in design of construction products\nWork with GCB R&W Taskforce to produce roadmap to Zero Avoidable Waste\n\n\n\nFurniture\n\nSet minimum standards for furniture on repairability, durability, reusability, recycled content\nEPR for bulky items\nSet requirements for improved labelling and consumer information\nFoster industry action via trade associations, VAs and industry standards through encouraging sharing of best practices\n\n\n\nTextiles\n\nSet minimum ecodesign standards for clothing on durability, reusability, recyclability and recycled content\nTextiles EPR\nWorking with WRAP through the next phase of the SCAP 2021-30 to galvanise voluntary actions across supply chains\n\n\n\nFood\n\nGet legal powers to introduce food waste reduction targets on businesses (if annual reporting insufficient to drive improvement); Get legal powers for surplus food redistribution obligations on businesses\nSupport cross-sector collaboration through the Courtauld 2025 agreement\nFund food redistribution organisations\nIntroduce mandatory annual reporting of food surplus and waste by food businesses of an appropriate size\nProducing and promoting sectoral food waste strategies for the: 1) hospitality sector; 2) public sector (updating Govt buying standards)\nSupport citizen campaigns e.g. Food Waste Action Week, Love Food Hate Waste\n\n\n\n\nWhile current policies as listed in government strategies may go some way to delivering improvements in resource efficiency and a UK CE, more stretching policies may need to be introduced to deliver greater levels of improvement both in the short-term (i.e. next 5 years) and beyond this, while the evidence-development process for many commitments may be relatively early and benefit from additional evidence-collection. The same may be said for other strategies across the countries making up the UK such as Wales’ Beyond Recycling (2021), Scotland’s Making Things Last (2016) and N. Ireland’s Circular Economy Strategy.\n\n\n\n\nAssessment against critical success factors\nWe assess key instruments making up the policymakers’ toolkit for delivering a more circular UK economy change against the following set of criteria or ‘Critical Success Factors’ (CSFs) - in the HM Treasury Green Book as ‘attributes essential to the successful delivery of projects and programmes’ (HM Treasury, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategic fit\n\n\n\n\n\nHow policy intervention supports ‘national, regional, local or organisational policies, initiatives and targets’, align with other projects and programmes and fits with wider business strategy of UK public bodies (HM Treasury, 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffectiveness and efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is often a high level of uncertainty regarding the impacts of policy change, with this based on a range of factors. To assess effectiveness, we capture evidence on the effect of instruments in relation to objectives such as reducing (primary) resource use, waste generation, reducing leakage and improving waste treatment and including the immediacy (indicative time required to implement) with which these effects arise and certainty of meeting aims (predictability). We also consider evidence on how efficiently outcomes are delivered (value for money) and the role of instruments in moving the UK towards a more optimal distribution of goods, services and pollution (allocative efficiency). We include findings from both cost-effectiveness analysis2 and cost-benefit analysis3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial cost to the public sector\n\n\n\n\n\nA key part of moving from theoretical to actual benefits is political and administrative feasibility (the ability to put a policy into effect in a given context), with government affordability an important parts of this (OECD, 1999). In addition to considering evidence on abatement and compliance costs from the perspective of the regulatee, we look for evidence on direct and indirect administrative costs to government (including at policy design and enforcement stages) of instruments, as well as evidence on revenues generated which can offset these (HMT, 2022).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-run effects\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look for evidence on the long-run effects of instruments and their ability to meet regulatory aims persistently into the future while providing incentives for continued improvements beyond the minimum. This includes their continued effectiveness under a variety of circumstances and resilience to external changes such as inflation, ability to be updated in response to new information and capacity to harness technological change through providing incentives for innovation over time so as to lower the costs of achieving goals over time (Fiorino, 2004).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributional and equity effects\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the net-effects of instruments on different people and groups, and how these may exacerbate pre-existing inequities (Bryant and Bailey, 1997). Evidence of regressive effects across income strata, geography concerning any of the groups identified by the Equality Act 2010 as well as disproportionate burdens on small and micro businesses are sought to be captured (RPC, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpillovers\n\n\n\n\n\nWe look for evidence on spillovers, both positive and negative and including: 1) Soft effects such as impacts on attitudes, awareness and learning; 2) Wider economic impacts including on innovation and trade; and 3) Perverse incentives and any contribution to potentially unintended consequences such as negatively impacting competition or giving rise to cross-media impacts.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModelling blueprints\nTo inform the modelling of policy pathways in a consistent and transparent way, one output of the review is a set of ‘modelling blueprints’ (Donati et al. 2020). These are a collection of assumptions informed by our evidence collection and structured in a way as to feed into core utilised appraisal frameworks. These are framed within a social accounting matrix (SAM) i.e. ‘a comprehensive and economy-wide database recording data about all transactions between economic agents in a specific economy for a specific period of time’ (Causapé, Ferrari and McDonald, 2018).\nThe policy taxonomy modelling blueprints presented here link to the CE-Hub’s agnostic value-chain taxonomy developed to provide a consistent representation of actors, activities and flows and stocks along a given value chain. These can be used together to identify the who and how of targetting interventions to drive change towards more circular and sustainable UK economies (IRP, 2021). The institutional and industrial sector classifications of the System of National Accounts can be superimposed on this ‘ecosystem model’ in the following ways… This links naturally also then to actors groups in multiregional input-output and macroeconomic analysis approaches.\n\n\n\n\nMacFeely (2011)\n\n\n\nEnd-points derived from our evidence review for use in modelling potential impacts of different policy types therefore include estimates for:\n\nlikely penetration rates - for instance, a voluntary approach could be expected to have a lesser participation rate than a mandatory approach, those even mandatory approaches may have freeriders where enforcement is low;\nlikely scale of effect per participant5;\nthe potential immediacy of an instrument’s effects following introduction;\npotential costs and long-run effects such as innovation that may serve to reduce these; and\nspillover effects.\n\nThese evidence-derived assumptions can be used alongside additional hypothetical policy assumptions including:\n\nThe scope of a lever e.g. whether a policy is applied to computers or all small appliances and institutional scope - i.e. to whom the lever would apply and any exemptions;\nThe focus of the instrument e.g. reducing production leakage, lightweighting and material substitution or lifespan extension;\nAt what level the lever is set e.g. the length of the mandatory minimum lifetime of product or rate of tax applied; and\nWhen the lever is introduced, including accounting for sequencing and interaction effects\n\nto input to the modelling of policy impacts in a consistent way. We outline the input requirements of core appraisal methodologies below. These approaches are increasingly being used in conjunction with one another to answer stakeholder questions relating to the circular economy (Hellweg et al. 2023).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCost-benefit analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general steps of CBA are (Boardman et al. ; Atkinson et al. 2018):\n\nSelecting the portfolio of options for projects or policies;\nEstablishing a baseline for comparison to indicate the counterfactual;\nDetermine who has ‘standing’ and we are interested in the benefits and costs of counting i.e. the affected population for a study e.g. a watershed’s population; \nIdentify, list and quantify potential physical impacts for the life of the project or policy; \nMonetize impacts for each time period; \n\nAll goods and services for which individuals have preferences and therefore value having more of than current provisions & all the things people wants where provision has an opportunity cost.\nCalculating the net sum of all the relevant WTPs and WTAs for a project outcome or policy change defines the total economic value (TEV) of any change in wellbeing due to a project or policy. TEV can be characterised differently according to the type of economic value arising. Total Economic Value is the summation of use and non-use values. Use value is understood as welfare generated through the actual utilization of the environment and can be further categorized into two forms of actual use values - direct and indirect, in addition to an option value of later use (Pearce et al. 1989). Direct-use values refer to welfare that the current utilization of a resource confers such as water in a production process or for recreation. Direct use values will either be derived consumptively or non-consumptively depending on whether the utilization of those resource lead it to being rendered unusable to other potential beneficiaries. Indirect use-values are those indirect benefits of ecosystems which impact welfare through the services that ecosystems provide (Munasinghe and Schwab, 1993). ‘Option use value’ refers to the preferences people may have for utilizing a resource in the future. Non-use values are those non-instrumental benefits attributed to the environment and includes ‘existence values’ i.e. the preference a society has for knowing a particular resource exists in and of itself; ‘altruistic value’ i.e. the preferences a society may have for others within the current generation being able to use the resource in question; and ‘bequest values’ - the preferences societies have for passing on resources to future generations. \nBenefits - Outputs of the project which increase human welfare, the value of which are assessed based on how much someone is willing to pay for that benefit, even for the likes of avoided costs. A benefit or gain in an individual’s wellbeing (utility or welfare) can be measured by the maximum amount of goods or services – or money income (or wealth) – that he or she would be willing to give up or forego in order to obtain the change. Demand curves for environmental goods and amenities and therefore WTP can be affected  (moved out and slope changed) by: 1) recognition of the importance of a good (increased recognition of the value of clean water, clean air); 2) knowledge of an additional cost accrued through using a good (e.g. illness through GM crops).\nCosts = Outputs of a project that decrease human welfare, which include input costs. Taxonomy depends on kind of project e.g. conservation projects might be decomposed into acquisition, establishment, operations and maintenance costs, transaction and opportunity costs. Generally they are decomposed into: 1) Capital costs; 2) Operation Costs; 3) Externality Costs. In a more traditional economic sense, these are measured as the cost of producing a product (if produced via inputs on the free market then this can be valued easily) and the opportunity cost of using these inputs (consists of the maximum value of other outputs to which the resources used in one way could have been used in the second most efficient manner).\nPrivate and Social Costs: Private costs accrue to those making a product. Social costs accrue to the society surrounding that person making the product and is the summation of all costs (MSC + MPC).\n\nAggregation then involves all benefits and costs being summed to calculate net benefits while discounting for future benefits and costs depending on the social discount rate; \n\nWe discount future values into those that are present-day through the use of a discount rate to account for society’s preferences for benefits now rather than later and its lesser concern for costs in the future versus those now on one hand, and the opportunity cost of capital given economic productivity on the other (Speer et al. 2015). The choice of discount rate embodies important normative assumptions regarding intergenerational equity and short-termism. Boardman et al. (2006) recommend a real social discount rate of 3.5% be used for studies 1-50 year into the future, with this increasing past a 50 year period. \nSensitivity analysis can then be used to test the sensitivity of the net benefit to changes in its determinants as an indication of uncertainty;\n\nRisk and uncertainty: Benefits and costs will not be known with certainty. While conventions vary, it seems fair to distinguish “risk” from “uncertainty” in clarifying what this means and its implications for CBA. A risk context is one where benefits and/or costs are not known with certainty, but a probability distribution is known. Sometimes these probability distributions can be very crude. On some occasions they can be sophisticated. A context of uncertainty is different. There is no known probability distribution. End points might be known, i.e. it is known or expected that the value cannot be less than a number, and that it cannot be more than another number. But, in other cases, there may be pure uncertainty in the sense that “anything may happen”. \nIf the context is one of uncertainty, i.e. the distribution of benefits (costs) is not known, then, at the very least, CBA requires that a sensitivity analysis is performed. Sensitivity analysis requires that the CBA is computed using different values of the parameters about which there is uncertainty. Such procedures require some assumption about likely minima and maxima, but do not necessarily make assumptions about the distribution of values between these limits. For example, if a discount rate of 4% is chosen as the central case, then, say, 2 and 6% could also be chosen for a sensitivity analysis. One possible outcome is that the sign of the net benefits will be unaffected by these alternatives, in which case the analysis is said to be “robust” with respect to these assumptions. In other cases, changing assumptions may alter the CBA result. \n\n\nResults are presented either as a net benefit (B-C) or a benefit-cost ratio (B/C); \nOptions are selected based on the following decision-rules:\n\nIf options are mutually exclusive, choose X because it has the highest Net-Benefit. If options can be chosen independently, choose X,Y, or Z, because all have NB &gt; 0, and these can be ranked by their cost-benefit ratio. If options can be chosen independently, but money is limited (£100), then choose Y and Z because they provide the highest total NB before money runs out (Ranked by B/C). \n\n\n\nDiscounting is used to account for:\n\npositive temporal preferences of society for benefits now over benefits in the future, and lesser concern for costs arising in the future than those in the present. Simply put people consider £1 now to be more valuable than £1 in the next period, such that individuals would be indifferent between a £1 now and somewhat more than £1 next year. This can be due to impatience, survival risks and us being richer later on (so marginal value of the capital will then be less). This extra is called the rate of time preference (RTP); \neconomic productivity - rather have £1 now than later because of a positive rate of interest in the economy and opportunity costs being equal to returns on investment. This stems from the fact capital is productive and that by investing in capital now, we can ensure greater returns in the next period. Simply put, for every £1 we invest now, we get £1 plus some extra back in the next period. This extra is called the opportunity cost rate (OCR) since it is the opportunity cost (the consumption foregone in the next period) by consuming now and not investing in productive capital. Opportunity cost is equal to the potential return on investment of resources used to an alternate end. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-opportunity analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen standard assumptions of welfare economics and CBA are met, optimisation models can play an important role in analysing the potential impact of policies or projects on the allocation of existing economic resources. Where assumptions for welfare economics CBA are not met however, models should be selected which don’t impose the existence of economic equilibrium, that incoporate heterogeneous actors and that represent system dynamics rather than calculate outcomes at moments in time e.g. agent-based models, system dynamics models and non-equilibrium macro-econometric models.\nSharpe et al.(2021) also recommend the use of ‘risk opportunity analysis’ (ROA) which is a more general form of cost-benefit analysis. ROA steps involve:\n\nSystem boundaries are delimited, and all relevant interactions and positive and negative feedbacks are identified; (suitable models, if required, are chosen or designed);\nThe potential effects (intended and unintended) of policy options in the economy are assessed, and uncertainty ranges estimated;\n\nMapping the relationships between components of the economic system of concern, in terms of reinforcing and balancing feedbacks\nIdentifying the likely effect of policy interventions on system behaviour, based on changes to the structure of relationships between components (including relationships created by other policies that already exist or are under consideration). This may be extended to include the creation of a range of scenarios and storylines of cumulative causation that result from policy action, where longer-term effects are likely to be important to policy objectives;\nComparing likely effects in terms of:\n\nDirection of change (of any variables of policy interest)\nMagnitude of change (which may or may not be quantifiable)\nPace of change\nPossible accumulation of risk and opportunity (option generation)\nConfidence, or range of uncertainty, in each of i to iv above.\n\n\nThe risks and opportunities of options (including most likely, best-case and worst-case outcomes) are compared along multiple relevant metrics and dimensions (where probabilities may be quantifiable or unquantifiable). This includes consideration of systemic risk (breakdown of an existing system), and systemic opportunity (where policy generates a whole new system, or set of opportunities);\nThe preferred option is determined by the decision-maker based on a qualitative judgment of the scale of the opportunities and risks, compared to the cost of the intervention. This will necessarily be a subjective judgment (since it incorporates a weighing of outcomes in different dimensions), informed by an objective assessment of likelihood and magnitude of possible outcomes in each of the relevant dimensions; and\nA clear statement of the reasoning behind the decision is recorded including the decisionmaking body’s assessment of the risks and opportunities in their various dimensions. (This can be helpful for transparency and for learning from experience).\n\nKey differences in ROA to CBA are that multiple metrics are used, the focus is on expected processes that drive change rather than outcomes, unquantified risks and opportunities are central to consideration so expected values are not used, policy should aim for maximum leverage in the desired direction of change and interventions should be enough to generate self-reinforcing change in desired direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystems dynamics models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMultiregional input-output analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nMcCarthy, Dellink and Bibas (2018) identify two broad approaches in the literature for ex ante modelling of the potential economic implications of greater resource efficiency delivered through a more circular economy: \n\n‘Accounting modelling’ approaches: These generally involve developing scenarios in one or more sectors (with changes often modelled autonomously of policies) and drawing on expert opinion to estimate potential economic impacts in the form of costs savings or job creation. In some cases, input-output tables or multipliers are used to estimate indirect effects from changes in demand and production structures. A key benefit of this approach is the transparency of modelling, while a perceived drawback is not incorporating the influence of relative price changes and how households and firms may react to these through time nor the complexity of transitions around interactions between drivers as well as second-order feedback effects.\n‘Macroeconomic modelling’ approaches: These approaches encompass economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) or macroeconometric models. CGE models use mathematic equations to represent optimisation of households and firms in line with general equilibrium theory, while econometric time series models are based on econometrically estimated dynamics allowing disequilibrium effects and bounded rationality to be accounted for. A key benefit of CGE and macroeconometric models is their more explicit incorporation of the role that prices may play in determining supply and demand. A perceived weakness with CGE models is the restrictive assumptions which can underpin them, while for macroeconometric models, there is an argument that the assumption of historical behaviour guiding future economic interactions may be misplaced when dealing with ‘out of sample’ changes in the economy.\n\n\nInput-output models\n\nInput-output tables\nInput-output economics was initially developed by the Russian-American economist Wassily Leontief (1936) building on earlier work by Walras and Quesnay. Input-Output Tables (IOTs) are published by a growing number of countries as part of their national economic accounts. IOTs, in an aggregated and monetary presentation, describe the structure of an economy in terms of the interdependencies between its sectors. National-level IOTs across countries have been compiled in Multiregional Input-Output (MRIO) databases to provide a picture of interdependencies between sectors in different countries.\n\n\nEnvironmentally-extended input-output analysis\nEconomic data contained in (MR)IOTs can be combined with environmental data, such as on emissions or material extraction, to enable paired economic-environmental analysis. An Environmentally-Extended Multiregional Input-Output (EE-MRIO) table is an integrated dataset that combines a Monetary Input-Output table (MIOT) representing monetary inter-industry flows and final demand within and across regions, and an extension table in physical units depicting environmental flows associated with those economic activities (Wiedland et al. 2019).\nTo study the economy-wide implications of applying material efficiency on emissions, employment, domestic value added and resource use, input-output models have been used, either at the level of individual economies (Scott et al., 2019), or for the global economy (Donati et al., 2020; Wiebe et al., 2019). Input-output data is collected by countries in accordance with the System for National Accounts in a relatively consistent way and can therefore be compiled in databases called multi-regional input-output (MRIO) databases. Input-output models (IOMs) describe the structure of the economy and the interdependencies between sectors. For each economic sector, these models contain, in an aggregated and monetary presentation, goods that are needed (the inputs) across sectors and the goods that are produced (the outputs). By linking all in- and outputs to sectors or final demand, an economy-wide ‘transaction’ overview is provided. The models typically contain information about output, income of households, jobs and added value while environmental extensions can also be added.\nAguilla-Hernandez et al. (2018) in a review of publications analysing interventions associated with a more circular economy through Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Modelling (EE-IOMs), summarised:\n‘Our findings show that residual waste management can be modelled by increasing the amount of waste flows absorbed by the waste treatment sector. Closing supply chains can be modelled by adjusting input and output coefficients to reuse and recycling activities and specifying such actions in the EEIOA model if they are not explicitly presented. Product lifetime extension can be modelled by combining an adapted final demand with adjusted input coefficients in production. The impacts of resource efficiency can be modelled by lowering input coefficients for a given output’\nIOMs can also be used to model the economic impacts of circular economy interventions. This can involve drawing on expert opinion to estimate the potential economic impacts of interventions in the form of cost savings or job creation in one or more sectors, with indirect impacts along supply-chains accounted for. To assess induced economic impacts of interventions beyond sectors immediately affected, multipliers can be used. The general limiting factor for IO approaches is that they don’t have the capacity to account for changes in relative prices that interventions can stimulate and how firms and households react to these, which can have implications for both environmental and economic conclusions.\nTo assess the wider economic impact of policies through IOMs beyond sectors immediately affected, IO multipliers can be used. Changes driven by policies may be associated with the creation of new jobs or revenues in one sector directly, but also induce additional jobs in sectors supply goods to that sector (indirect impact). These effects may serve to induce new final demand, further delivering economic growth/change to the economy (induced impact). Assumptions underpinning multipliers need to be accounted for: 1) Firms in an economic sector are often diverse and changes in the economy linked to resource efficiency interventions may result in new business models with different inputs and outputs. In such cases, available multipliers may misjudge the impact of activities; 2) input-output multipliers assume fixed input coefficients in production and therefore price changes of production inputs will not induce changes in the relative share of different inputs for production; 3) multipliers do not take factor markets into account such that a sector can grow without incorporating crowding-out effects of additional demand. For instance, additional jobs from new investment may lead to crowding-out effects resulting in higher wages throughout the economy which may restrain the initial economic impact. As a result, IO multipliers can overestimate impacts of changes. The general limiting factor for IO approaches is that they don’t effectively account for changes in relative prices that interventions stimulate and how firms and households react to these. Applications include:\n\nBarrett et al. (2009) assessed the possible impacts of 13 resource efficiency strategies on reducing emission to 2020.\nScott et al. (2019) analysed at the level of the UK using input-output models\nNorman et al. (2021)\nWiebe et al. (2019) utilise MRIO analysis models for their ability to support analysis within a context of industry interdependencies, within and between countries, intermediate and final demand and producers and consumers. Project EXIOBASE at a global level to 2030 based on exogenous parameters included in the IEA Energy Technology Perspective’s 6-degree scenario, comparing this reference scenario to a circular economy scenario associated with more recycling, material efficiency increases, repair and reuse and assessing impacts on material extraction, employment and value added per sector. Find global material extraction fell by about 10% compared to the baseline with a small positive impact on employment.\n\n\n\nMacroeconomic analysis\nMacroeconomic models are also built on IOTs, but seek to incorporate microeconomic theory and the role of prices within their dynamics. Macroeconomic models encompass both economy-wide computable general equilibrium (CGE) and macroeconometric models. CGE models use mathematic equations to represent optimisation of households and firms in line with microeconomic general equilibrium theory. Econometric time series models are based on econometrically estimated dynamics, which therefore allow disequilibrium effects and bounded rationality to be accounted for. \n\nComputable General Equilibrium Models\nComputable general equilibrium (CGE) models are a class of economic models that combine use of input-output data with the application of microeconomic theory. CGE models can be statistic i.e. assuming changes happen instantly or dynamic through assuming some elements are sticky and take time to materialise. The mathematic approach of CGE models can allow flexibility in modelling production curves and consumption behaviour as the explicit incorporation of prices in determining demand and supply for products and materials is a key advantage over expert judgement and IO approaches. Grounded in general equilibrium theory, a limiting factor of CGE models is argued by some to be their assumptions of perfect competition in markets and that all markets clear, meaning for instance, that there is no unemployment. Applications include:\n\nBohringer and Rutherford (2015) developed a multi-regional CGE model for the Ellen MacArthur foundation (Ellen MacArthur Foundation and McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, 2015) with a specific focus on the circular economy. They state the importance of a global model to ensure important spill-over and feedback effects are fully captured and the model of the world is split into 5 regions (EU, North America, Other OECD, China and ROW) which each having 16 economic sectors. The model focuses in detail on transport, energy, households and food, and therefore it omits some areas in more detail (e.g. electricity generation technologies) and specifically there is almost no representation of other minerals and materials except with the construction sector and motor vehicles. Analysis results show GDP could be 11% higher in 2030 and 20% higher in 2050 than the baseline development scenario in a move towards a more circular economy. \nUsing the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model, Bibas, Chateau and Lanszi (2021) assessed the global economic and environmental impacts of fiscal reform consisting of taxes on primary metal and mineral resources and the circulation of revenues to finance subsidies to recycled goods and secondary metal production. They found this would deliver a relative decoupling of primary material use from economic growth to 2040, with a reduction of 7% in metallic and non-metallic minerals compared to the baseline scenario alongside negligible effect on global GDP (loss of 0.2% global GDP in 2040). Regional disparities were identified, depends on whether countries were net importers or exporters of raw materials, available production technologies and input costs of primary and secondary materials. Modelled tax rates are assumed to rise linearly to their target level between 2018-40.\n\n\n\nMacro-Econometric Models\nEconometric time series models are not based upon general equilibrium assumptions but instead consist of econometrically estimated behavioural relationships from outturn data which can consider short-and-medium-term economic impacts of various actors’ decisions while capturing disequilibrium effects and bounded rationality as behaviour in the past was not necessarily rational. Time lags between changes in industrial activity and household activity can also be accounted for based on this approach.\nEconometric approaches are not robust to the Lucas critique that behaviour in the past may not be relevant for future behaviour because expectations of economic actors may change with the introduction of new policy as ex ante analysis of resource efficiency policies are effectively ‘out of sample’. Transitions generally need structural changes in the incentives and behaviour of economic actors furthermore. Applications include:\n\nThe E3ME model was used in the CE and BioIS (2014) analysis for the European Commission examining scenarios of different resource productivity improvements to show under which conditions resource productivity increases can be achieved in the EU with positive macroeconomic impacts. Improvements in RP under each scenario assumed to come a third each from publicly funded investments in capital stock, privately funded business measures and MBIs. Pre-analysis undertaken to calculate abatement cost for each ‘user’ of each material using each policy type (MBI, regulation and investment). Scenarios considered in terms of impact of GDP (net benefits or net costs) and jobs.\nThe CCC’s 6th Carbon Budget focussed on measures while recognising Net Zero will be a policy-led transition. Initially undertook a microeconomic analyses stage estimating required capital investment for these measures based upon assumptions of costs for key technologies and how these might change into the future under different scenarios. Also accounted for operating costs, which represent the additional costs or savings of running the low-carbon solutions once they have been deployed relative to the cost of the high-carbon options they replace. Building on the estimates of annualised resource costs from the micro-level analysis, commissioned CE to analyse the macroeconomic implications of introducing recommended pathway against baseline using E3ME in terms of GDP change (relevant to this piece of legislation because under the original Climate Change Act, possibly a requirement that transition costs should not exceed a certain % of GDP).\n\nOECD identified the importance of good levels of sectoral disaggregation at the extraction stage. They identify a key issue in the social accounting matrixes underpinning ex ante macroeconomic analysis of the circular economy that there is generally no distinction made between facilities that use virgin natural resources and those using secondary raw materials in sectors that transform material inputs into outputs. While this is a lesser issue for materials that are not recycled or mostly recycled within the sector they are used in, it is more important for materials where secondary production utilises specific technologies and can be done through modelling different production technologies within one sector such that the same output is produced but using different input combinations. Other issues identified include that technological change6 is often modelled exogenously with assumptions made about achievable rates of technological improvement’s effect on technical efficiency that arise at effectively no-cost and result from introduced policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Modelling use-phase optimisation in input-output tables\n\n\n\n\n\nA range of policy approaches might be introduced to extend the lifespans of products, each with different characteristics and varying in their potential applicability given circumstances. For instance, regulatory standards might be levied on producers which require minimum product lifespans (e.g. in terms of minimum number of cycles) or the use of components, materials or production techniques that could support more durable or repairable products. Alternatively, consumption-focussed approaches might involve providing information to consumers about product lifespans via eco-labels in order to overcome information asymmetries and enable more green consumption. Additional approaches might include alterations to the VAT system to attempt to further incentivise repair over replacement. The effectiveness of these policies in extending product lifetimes will depend on the characteristics of the policy, technological conditions, reasons for lifespans being shorter than otherwise possible for the products in scope and on mediating factors for some policies such as the responsiveness of consumers to labels or the degree to which incentivisation via charge or price instruments might alter the costs of one activity in relation to another.\nApproaches to model this value driver in input-output tables include:\n\nMcCarthy, Dellink and Bibas (2018) set out two ways in which delayed product replacement is frequently modelled within macroeconomic assessments of the circular economy. The first is through decreasing the monetary volume of demand for the hypothetical longer-lived product, thereby lowering sale values and revenue to the producing sector. An alternative approach makes the assumption that products with longer lifespans are sold at higher prices by producers, such that the policy has no noticeable direct effect on the economy in monetary terms notwithstanding reduced material demand.\nDonati et al. (2020) set out approaches to simulating product lifetime extension in MRIO via two routes. For delayed product replacement, they suggest reducing transactions of new products (or components) and adjusting input coefficients in production to reflect increased product durability (also identified as an approach used in the literature by Aguilla-Hernendez et al. (2018). For lifetime extension via greater reuse and remanufacturing, they alternatively propose modelling this as a reduction in transactions of new products alongside increased spending on ancillary activities related to maintenance and repair services (see diagram below for the associated modelling blueprints they use for these interventions and their paper for additional blueprints).\nNorman et al. (2021) model product lifetime extension through reducing expenditure by firms in relevant intermediate sectors alongside reductions in final expenditure by household and governments while addressing macro-economic rebounds by increasing the size of the domestic repair economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy recommendations\nHow policy is designed and implemented is critical to reducing the economic burdens potentially posed by regulation such as increased barriers to market entry, reduced competition, transaction and administrative costs (Berestycki and Dechezleprêtre, 2020). Informed by the review undertaken and account for current commitments, recommendations for policy change are made grouped into the following categories, for which several may apply:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adjust\n\n\n\n\n\nHeightening or reducing the level of an existing lever e.g. increase the stringency of a tax\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Reconfigure\n\n\n\n\n\nAlter the design or implementation of a lever already in place beyond adjusting its level e.g. changing payment mechanisms or fee structures for extended producer responsibility schemes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Extend\n\n\n\n\n\nLevy existing regulation horizontally into new areas e.g. applying ecodesign regulations to other products or sectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Remove\n\n\n\n\n\nRemove an existing regulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Introduce\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduce a new lever where one is not currently in place with a specified level and design"

A 2023 review by the The European Court of Auditors found that ‘Overall there is limited evidence that the Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plans (CEAPs), and in particular the actions regarding the circular design of products and of production processes, were effective in influencing circular-economy activities in the member states.’\nThe 2012 Resource Security Action Plan led by Defra and BIS focussed on metals and minerals perceived to be of particular strategic importance but with uncertain supply. As part of the plan, strategies focussed on improved resource efficiency and increased secondary material use were viewed as promising ways to tackle potential scarcities. The plan emphasised recovery moreso than opening up new sources of materials (Hill, 2016). Critical Minerals Strategy.\nFollowing the 2017 Chief Scientific Advisors Office’s report ‘From Waste to Resource Productivity’ which called for the development of a national strategy to deliver this transition, the Resources and Waste Strategy (RWS) for England published in 2018 by Defra sets out a strategic ambition to double resource productivity and eliminate avoidable waste of all kinds by 2050 in line with the direction of the 25 Year Environment Plan.

    "text": "Design and implementation considerations\nBeyond the general prescription that current levels of primary material use in industrialised countries is likely higher that what might be sustainable (Bleischwitz, ), quantifying more precisely what a ‘sustainable’ level of resource use might look like, has proven difficult. Indeed, the very definition of sustainability is not without contention. The World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) in 1987 defined sustainable development as ‘development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own’. The capital framing of sustainable development interprets this as an injunction to preserve productive capacity for the indefinite future (Solow, 1993), so as to provide future generations with the opportunity to be as well off as those present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nProductive capacity is generally defined under this framing as a portfolio of capital assets e.g. built, human, social, financial and natural capital. While the constructed perspective of nature as an asset to be managed within a capital accounting framework may improve on more nebulous concepts of sustainability as a basis for measuring progress towards that aim (Barbier, 2010), natural capital differs from other types of capital assets on at least three important counts: 1) depreciation of NC is often irreversible once certain thresholds are passed, with limited opportunities for effective restoration (Benayas et al. 2013); 2) except in a limited sense, it isn’t possible to replace a depleted ecosystem with a new one, or even its components (Fritter, 2013); and 3) ecosystems can collapse abruptly (Dasgupta, 2008). Not only this, but natural capital remains the fundamental building block for all other forms of man-made capital and economic activity and underpins the survival of humans and other animals.\nHicks (1946) defined sustainable use as ‘the maximum amount that a community can consume over a given time period and still be as well off at the end of the period as at the beginning’. By ‘well off’, Hicks implied having the same capacity to produce income in a future year as in a year past, premised on maintaining a constant stock of capital capable of yielding goods and services valued by people. There exists significant debate as to the necessary composition of the portfolio of capital assets each generation should hand down to ensure futurity have the same opportunities for welfare as current generations have. In the presence of ecological thresholds, discontinuities, interlinkages, non-linearities, non-convexities and possible regime shifts driven by the likes of climate change, as well as some level of concern for non-human species, the optimal path of consumption of, and investment in, natural capital derived within a dynamic welfare maximizing framework is likely to mimic as close to a strong sustainability rule as possible i.e. the value of our natural capital should be maintained, if not enhanced (Irwin, Gopalakrishnan and Randall, 2016), with this particularly the case for industrialized nations that are often relatively ecologically denuded (Helm, ). While it might be seen that in an ‘empty world’ where levels of human-made capital was a limiting factor to development and natural capital is superabundant, substitution of natural for human capital was likely to bring additional human welfare benefits, in a ‘fuller world’ (particularly for industrialized countries) associated with greater quantities of human capital but relatively less natural capital, this limit has increasingly become a limiting factor (Daly, 1995).\nOveruse might be written as E&gt;A (where r is emissions of residuals and a is the assimilative/regenerative/absorptive capacity of the receiving environment). Overuse will depend on the nature of the pollutant e.g. CO2 as a stock pollutant residuals in the atmosphere for ~60 years, makinf assimilative capacity lower across a human lifetime and therefore optimal pollution rate per annum lower too). Given sink functions are amost always unpriced, over-use is almost always the likely outcome, necessitating governance and policy oversight.\nIn light of recognition of the non-substitutability between diferent types of natural capital, SS proponents e.g. Costanza and Daly (1992) have dropped aggregate natural capital rule and argue instead that minimum stocks of all natural resources should be maintained (Faucheux and O’Connor, 1995).\nThough overuse might be resource-specific, it can also be linked to other resource limits through ecosystems due to their interconnectedness, that is, use/renewal rates cannot always be dealt with in isolation due to ecological contingencies.\nThe snowballing number of nations introducing targets at a national level on greenhouse gas emissions as coordinated under the UNFCCC (firstly the prescriptive and market-based of the Kyoto Protocol and more recently the self-declarative INDCs under the Paris Accord), alongside co-regulation by the private sector, the public and charities, is focussed on tackling one of the most serious impacts on the environment by human societies – greenhouse gas emissions. It is becoming increasingly recognised that environmental impacts cannot be effectively mitigated by focussing on emissions abatement alone, however (Bringezu et al. 2017).\nBeyond availability of stocks of resources, what are the planetary boundaries within which our consumption should be restrained in order to support sustainability.\nMont et al. (2013) estimate a sustainable per capita consumption of resources would be around 8 tonnes.\nSome have sought to estimate what a sustainable per capita level of resource use could look like. For instance, Bringezu (2015) proposed a material footprint of 5-10 tonnes per capita while O’Neill et al. (2018) propose a ‘per capita boundary’ of material use of 7.2 t y-1.\nAssume that a ‘sustainable’ level of global per capita resource use today might be between 5-10 tonnes. Accounting for the impact of future population growth on this by assuming technology will counteract it…. Assuming a level of GDP of GBP 4 trillion in 2050, achieving a sustainable per capita level of resource use in 2050 of 5 tonnes would require reducing RMC by X times, equating to an increased RP by X relative to 2017 figures, while achieving a per capita level of resource use of 10 tonnes would require RP increasing by X.\nIRP will be publishing report ’Defining Sustainable Levels of Resource Use (2021)\nBringezu (2019)\nResource use\nIn physical terms, depreciation of renewable resources arises when:\nR &gt; g\nWhere R is the rate of resource use and g is the natural growth/renewal rate of the renewable asset in question, while overuse of non-renewable resources arises when:\nR &gt; 0\nWhere R is the rate of resource use, implying that any level of resource use greater than 0 might be understood as unsustainable given non-renewable capital cannot, by definition, be replenished at an equal rate within a meaningful timeframe for an individual human.\nWaste production\nIn physical terms, environmental overuse as a result of anthropogenic waste production arises when:\nE &gt; A\nWhere E is emissions of waste residuals and A is the assimilative capacity of the receiving environment.\nBeyond the general prescription that current levels of primary material use in industrialised countries is likely greater than a sustainable level (Bleischwitz, ), quantifying more precisely what a ‘sustainable’ level of resource use might look like has proven difficult. The environmental science around resource use is currently far weaker than that associated with the climate specifically. It therefore remains difficult to say with any degree of certainty, what might constitute a ‘sustainable level of resource use’ (Bleischwitz, ), least not due to differing interpretations of sustainability. Complicating the matter is the fact that environmental impacts vary by material type, and thus not only overall tonnages but also the composition of material use must be considered (unlike for globally intermixing gasses such as carbon dioxide), while in addition, the environmental intensity of resource use can be moderated by technologies of extraction and production which may improve with time. Notwithstanding the significant uncertainty associated with such estimates, several authors have sought to estimate what an acceptable level of material extraction globally might be, variously accounting for the potential resource and waste-related environmental limits. Dittrich et al. (2012), for instance, suggest that global material extraction should not exceed 50 Gt y-1, about half the level evident today and equating to a global per capita limit of 8 tonnes y-1 by 2030. This level was echoed in a separate analysis by Hoekstra and Wiedmann (2014) and Mont et al. (2013) in O’Neill et al. 2018. UNEP’s International Resource Panel (IRP) recommends a per capita target of between 6 and 8 tonnes y-1 by 2050 (2014). Bringenzu (2015) based on a higher population growth projection than that used in the IRP study, suggests a per capita target value of 5 tonnes for the year 2050, with a range of 3-6 tonnes (based on returning to year 2000 material use of 50.8 Gt).\nBringezu (2019) – it has been suggested to limit the cropland required for final consumption of agricultural goods to 0.20 ha/person in 2030, corresponding to 0.16 ha/person in 2050 in order to halt the loss of global biodiversity by land use change.\n\nGross Domestic Product\nThe historical roots of national accounting span back to determining the tax base of nations in the times of the Domesday Book (1085-86) and possibly earlier. Petty (1665) and King (1695) produced some of the first estimates of national income in Europe (Maddison, 2003; Vanoli, 2016). However, such estimates were produced intermittently and in a largely unstandardised way. National accounting in its modern-day form was introduced from the 1920s, pioneered by Kuznets in the USA and Clark in the UK to support macroeconomic policy aimed at mobilizing economic resources following the Great Depression and leading into World War 2. The System of National Accounts (SNA) - an internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity - was introduced by the United Nations (UN) in the 1950s to support international comparability of the statistics countries were collecting. Most countries now compile statistics about their economy in accordance with the UN-SNA which represents a rigorous accounting framework (Malinvaud, 1973).\nGross domestic product (GDP) ‘combines into a single figure…[the monetary value of] the [market] output…carried out by all the firms, non-profit institutions, government bodies and households in a given territory during a given period, provided that the production takes place within the country’s economic territory’ (OECD, 2014, p.15). GDP is a headline measure of the SNA and the most widely used metric for measuring national economic development at present.[1] Reference to economic growth today is generally in reference to the level of output in an economy relative to prior years as measured by inflation-adjusted GDP. Growth in GDP is frequently an implicit, if not explicit, target that national governments subscribe to.\nEconomic value can be understood as being created through production activities, with ‘value added’ what remains after the costs of production are accounted for, from which income e.g. wages or share dividends is derived. This income is then either spent or saved as financial or non-financial assets and in some cases re-lent back into the economy. Under the production approach, GDP at market prices is equivalent to national gross value added (GVA) - which is a measure of the increase in the value of the economy due to the production of goods and services - plus taxes and less subsidies, as so:\nWhere VA refers to value added across all firms, t is tax and s is subsidies. As a sum of expenditures on final goods and services by final users, GDP can alternatively be written as:\nWhere C is consumption (or expenditure in the economy on things the National Accounts categorises as consumption), I is investment (expenditure on domestic investment), G is expenditure by Government, X is the monetary value of exports and M, that of imports. GDP can lastly be calculated under the income approach, as the sum of primary and secondary income, compensation of employees and taxes and subsidies.\nEconomic production involves the variably consumptive conversion of production factors or capital stocks into income. Conceptually, economic welfare broadly constitutes the difference between the benefits and costs of such economic activity (Lawn, 2014). Economic growth as measured by change in GDP can be argued to be associated with an expansion in opportunities for material welfare given higher purchasing power and correlation with employment, thereby allowing people to: 1) buy goods and services providing welfare directly; and 2) pay taxes, enabling the state to provide public goods. The use of GDP as a proxy of economic welfare and for guiding societal development therefore has some key benefits, including a fit with the economic definition of preference satisfaction through consumption and the correlation that exists between per capita GDP and certain socially desirable outcomes such as reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy.\nThere are nevertheless several significant issues with the use of GDP as an effective indicator of societal development by itself. Kuznets himself recognised this, famously saying ‘the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income’ (1934). Issues with GDP identified include:\n1.        Using market prices as an indication of economic welfare is hampered by price distortions arising from monopoly, taxation, poor information and market imperfections;\n2.        The reliance on market prices and therefore on tracking market transactions means that many welfare benefits are overlooked altogether e.g. non-marketed household production, leisure or volunteer services which don’t lead to the production of goods. GDP therefore can be seen to represent a narrow conception of welfare;\n3.        The national accounts may mismeasure nominal GDP arising from new services such as those linked to the digital economy and not capture consumer surplus associated with such new services and quality-improved goods and services very effectively (Dynan and Sheiner, 2018);\n4.        GDP is not able to distinguish between production activities which contribute to economic welfare and those that reduce it, with the result being that economic income is not always correlated with economic welfare at a societal level;\n5.        As a ‘gross’ measure, GDP does not account for depreciation in underlying capital stocks on which economic activity is reliant. An insensitivity to depreciation in capital assets (whether produced or natural) which are central to long-term income, means GDP is poorly suited to telling us about the likely sustainability of income flows in the long-run. Indeed, focusing on maximizing GDP in the short-term can actually provide an incentive to deplete the capital stocks which underpin future human income as current returns are not considered alongside the opportunity cost to future output[2] (Dynan and Sheiner, 2018);\n6.        Aggregate measures of the national accounts such as GDP or the widely used measure of GDP per capita, do not provide insight into the distribution of income across society and may give an inaccurate picture of average welfare if income is unequally distributed.\nThere has been some disagreement at the margins around whether the use of GDP as a headline metric for economic development is warranted, with some commentators supporting the use of Gross National Income (GNI) instead on the basis of it providing an improved indicator of the monetary resources actually available to those who live in a country, while others support the use of Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) as a better indicator of the money actually available for consumption and saving activities. GNDI also includes both net factor income (captured by the GNI) as well as unilateral transfers, making it particularly relevant as a measure of interest for developing countries (Capelli and Vaggi, 2013).\nGiven the perceived breadth of issues identified with GDP however, some of which are outlined above, and galvanised at an international level by the 1992 Earth Summit, there has been a push to develop quite significantly different measures of societal development altogether to GDP.\nStiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi (2009) in a seminal review undertaken at the request of the then President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, argued that society not only needs to be steered by a more comprehensive measure of economic and societal progress than GDP, but also that no single composite measure could summarize something as complex as the magnitude and sustainability of the welfare of members of society. The review instead proposes countries use a dashboard of indicators which:\n1.        Expand the measure of human welfare to cover material welfare, health, education & knowledge, quality of personal activities including work, degree of involvement in political & social life and environmental quality. Expanded welfare measures generally look to capture and track contributions to human wellbeing outside of economic income e.g. health or education without the benefits of these necessarily needing to be captured within increased output or income;\n2.        Incorporate a measure of income distribution e.g. using median rather than mean incomes; and\n3.        Measure change in underpinning capital stocks e.g. natural, built and human capital on which welfare is reliant.\nWe outline just a few of the many alternative measures to GDP which have been proposed below. These are broadly arranged into those seeking to alter or augment the SNA and its headline measures in some way, and those proposed largely outside of the SNA.\n\nDevelopments within the System for National Accounts\nIncorporating information on natural assets into standard accounting frameworks is argued to be essential by some in order to mainstream environmental information and broaden the evidence base for economic decisions (Obst and Vardon, 2014; Solow, 1993). Since the 1980s, the SNA has been augmented in two main ways to attempt to account for sustainability concerns (Spash, 2000):\n1.        By expanding the national accounts to include environmental data sets through Satellite Accounts; and\n2.        By seeking to correct SNA aggregate measures such as GDP to take fuller account of the depletion of natural resources and the deterioration of environmental functions.\n\nIndicators supplementing GDP\n\n\nCapital accounting[3]\nGDP and other aggregate indicators of the national accounts are flow rather than wealth measures. National accounts are increasingly composed of balance sheets. Hamilton and Naikal (2014) categorise total societal wealth into produced, natural and intangible capital, with the latter an aggregate including human, social and institutional capital, generally calculated as a residual in assessments of wealth after the value of other inputs are accounted for. The World Bank (2010) find tangible assets only account for a relatively small proportion of total wealth (in money value) across all countries while intangible assets make up 60-80% of wealth across countries. Types of capital stocks include:\n•         Natural capital - The stock of renewable and non-renewable elements of the natural world (e.g. plants, animals, air, water, soils, minerals) that separately or in combination, yield a flow of benefits (use, option and non-use values) to people, and which can otherwise be depreciated by pollution and overuse, conserved and invested in through restoration. Ecological landscapes are the ‘basic unit of most ecological processes and the goods and services derived from them’ (Barbier 2015, p.26). The derivation of value from the natural world often relies on other types of capital for transformation into goods and services;\n•         Built capital - Material goods or fixed assets e.g. buildings, infrastructure and machinery which contribute to the production process rather than being the output itself e.g. tools, machines, buildings (the SNA already measured change in these assets);\n•         Human capital - The human capacities to transform tangible assets into outputs through endowments of education, specific knowledge and the wider abilities and qualities of people that make them productive (Becker; Dawson & Martin, 2015). Julian Simon, for example, argued the ultimate resource was the human mind;\n•         Social and institutional capital - Factors such as the quality of institutions, rule of law, governance, and the relationships between people in the form of networks, norms and trust which work to lower transaction costs and support innovation (Maskell, 2002);\n•         Health capital - Arrow et al. (2010) find the value of “health capital” is significant relative to other forms of capital, however this is generally not a category reflected widely in studies of wealth; and\n•         Financial capital - Used as a store of value and enabler of exchange. The most fungible form of capital and often an essential enabler of production alongside those other forms of capital outlined, though only as valuable as shared perceptions of its worth.\nTo better account for changes in natural capital and economic-environment relations, the SNA was added to by the satellite UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounts-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) in 2012, which consists of:\n1.        Asset Accounts – estimating the physical and monetary value of stocks of natural resources;\n2.        Physical Flow Accounts – showing how the environment contributes to the economy via physical flows e.g. through the extraction of raw materials as captured in the Environmental Accounts, the impacts that the economy has on the environment for instance through air emissions as captured in the Atmospheric Emissions Accounts and other residual flows e.g. solid waste.; and\n3.        Environmental-Activity Accounts - showing how society responds to environmental issues through environmental protection e.g. taxation and resource management expenditures. When such tax data is combined with physical data at a national or industry level, it is possible to see whether increasing taxes has an effect on environmental performance over time.\nThe SEEA-CF physical flow accounts are consistent with the economic flows data produced by the SNA, making it possible to link economic developments e.g. output and value added, to natural resource inputs and generation of residuals as well as expenditure data (Hoekstra, 2020).\nThe SEEA-CF focusses on environmental flows that are separable. To consider more systemic changes in ecosystem conditions, the SEEA-CF was added to by the SEEA-Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA) in 2013. The SEEA-EEA provide a spatially explicit approach to quantifying changes in ecosystems through GIS mapping of the extent and condition of ecosystems. The modelling tool ARIES have been developed to lower the barriers to compiling these complicated datasets via tools such as machine reasoning.\nNatural Capital Accounts (NCA) differ to the Environmental Accounts (EA) by summarising the physical annual flows of services provided by the natural environment rather than the pressures placed on the environment. In some instances, the two accounts mirror one another e.g. in the case of oil extraction, the use of these as an input into economic activities recorded in the EA equals the supply of provisioning services of oil from natural capital as recorded in the NCA. In other cases however, the relationship is not as direct (Bright et al. 2019). The NCA also attempts to track the waste remediation services that nature provides to people in the UK e.g. via the sequestration of pollution as well as flows of cultural services derived by people.\nWith significant developments in the SEEA and SEEA-EEA in the last decade, the technical push to develop natural capital accounts has proceeded largely independent of the pull of policy makers for a long time, however increasingly, barriers to considering environmental factors through the SNA is not a wholesale lack of data but rather the lack of awareness of available data and mainstreaming of this as a means of assessing policy questions (Vardon, Burnett and Dovers, 2016). Valuation of assets is largely done on a domestic basis, however there is a place for the further development in linking degradation of natural capital assets to consumptive pressures (Argawala, 2019), as has been done for consumption-based emissions and material flow accounting (e.g. Owen et al. 2020).\nThe Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI) most recently put forward in the Dasgupta Review (2021), proposes that countries track the aggregate value of all capital assets as a better indication of economic progress than GDP, with increases in inclusive wealth indicating an improved productive base capable of supporting living standards into the future, and decreasing values, the opposite. The weak sustainability grounding of the indicator through its implicit acceptance of growth in non-natural capital being able to offset losses in natural capital is illustrated in the findings of the 2012 Inclusive Wealth Report, which suggested that across the twenty countries measured using the IWI, human capital growth was found to offset declines in natural capital, while technological innovation and oil capital gains outweighed declines in other natural capital and damage from climate change.\nA growing number of countries have developed expanded national balance sheets, though issues with the natural capital accounts compiled by national governments include:\n1.        Accounts in their current form are incomplete and thus limited by a lack of comprehensiveness e.g. omitting the value of soils and biodiversity, which is to a large extent due to disagreement over methodologies for measuring such assets but also data gaps; and\n2.        Monetary valuation of stocks are highly influenced by anticipated future values which are generally based on current rents. These valuations can therefore be subject to significant volatility depending on changes in the market, and ultimately human perception.[4]\n\n\nIndicators adjusting GDP\n\n\nGenuine Savings\nAs an example of a adjusted aggregate indicator, the measure of ‘genuine savings’ (GS) developed by Pearce and Atkinson (1993) attempts to link wealth accounting to flow measures of savings within the SNA, building on the stock-flow view of the economy found in Fisher (1911), Hicks (1939) and Samuelson (1961). The metric effectively incorporates an empirical expression of the Hartwick Rule and is thus grounded in weak sustainability theoretics. GS, otherwise referred to as ‘adjusted net savings’ within the UN Central Framework as well as by the World Bank, is an attempt to build on, but redefine, the methodology of ‘adjusted net national income’ (ANNI). ANNI itself modifies ‘net national income’ (NNI) (i.e. ‘gross national income’ (GNI) adjusted for consumption of fixed capital[5]) to further account for depreciation in natural capital[6] to estimate the income available for current consumption or alternatively investment to support future consumption.\nGS as a savings rather than income measure, alternatively adds to a country’s gross savings its educational expenditures and subtracts from this the value of fixed capital depreciation, natural resource depletion for a variety of resources and some pollution-damage costs. GS is presented as a percentage of GNI, with a negative GS representing a nation unsustainably drawing down its wealth by saving insufficiently, thereby impinging on the potential for future welfare. GS can be written in notation as:\n\n\nWhere GrS is ‘gross savings’ i.e. GDP minus consumption expenditure, from which depreciation in produced capital (PC) is subtracted to arrive at ‘net savings’, added to which is the change in human capital (HC) proxied by educational expenditure. Following this, a subtraction of the depletion of non-renewable resources (energy and materials) (NR) and net deforestation (ND) is undertaken to arrive at ‘depletion adjusted savings’, with a final further subtraction of damages from CO2 and particulate matter (D) made to estimate GS.\nWhen interpreting the indicator, if GS &lt; 0, then development is deemed unsustainable. The indicator therefore guides a country to either reduce levels of capital consumption or increase capital investment to the point where GS equals 0 or greater. GS has been evidenced in several assessments as robust, for instance, historically co-integrating with future consumption in the US, Britain and Germany (Hanley et al. 2016), though not across all studies (Ferreira and Vincent, 2005; Pezzey et al. 2006). Issues nevertheless identified include that GS:\n1.        Is ‘one sided’, in that it can only reliably highly the occurrence of negative environmental performance because a non-negative GS might not guarantee sustainability if GS has been persistently negative in the past (Asheim 1994; Pezzey and Withagen, 1995);\n2.        By bringing different types of capital stocks into the same measure and permitting an increase in one capital stock e.g. human capital to offset reductions in natural capital, biophysical limits to substitution seen by others as central to national sustainability issues might not be sufficiently captured;\n3.        May be unable to correctly signal economic unsustainability in the event that environmental marginal-damage-curves relevant to an economy are characterized by non-linearities (Hamilton and Naikal 2014b); \n4.        Is limited in its comprehensiveness in measuring change in natural capital by omitting the value of changes in environmental stocks including fisheries, groundwater, soils and biodiversity (Dietz and Neumayer 2004) due to data gaps and areas of un-agreed methodology, as well as inconsistencies in the treatment of environmental externalities (Neumayer, 2000);\n5.        The GS rule becomes more complex if the assumption of constant population is abandoned, with population growth negatively impacting sustainability once population growth is accounted for. GS therefore needs to be measured at a per-capita level for sustainable per capita welfare to be protected; \n6.        By being linked to standard accounting measures tracked at a national level, GS is not well suited to account for unsustainable pressures overseas from a population due to domestic consumption made possible through the occurrence of trade;\n7.        Its accounting of human capital savings is incomplete as depreciation of human capital is not estimated (Hamilton, 2003).\n\n\n\nDevelopments outside of the SNA\n\nIndicators replacing GDP\n\n\nExpanded Welfare Measures\n\nGenuine Progress Indicator\nThe ‘genuine progress indicator’ (GPI) attempts to track ‘genuine’ economic welfare arising through economic activity. GPI builds on Daly and Cobb’s (1992) Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). It departs from an estimate of personal consumption adjusted for income inequality, after which further adjustments are made to attempt to distinguish utility-increasing expenditures on one hand from defensive expenditures (Daly and Cobb, 1989) and environmental damages (Vemuri and Costanza, 2006) on the other.\nMore specifically, the production of GPI involves adjusting personal consumption figures with economic indicators accounting for inequality, the timing of welfare benefits derived from durable consumer goods, the costs of unemployment and net capital investment within economic domains. Further adjustments are made to account for the costs of water, air and noise pollution, the loss of ecosystem services and the depletion of non-renewable ecosystem services within the environmental domain. For social aspects, an attempt is made to account for the value of work within the household, costs of family changes and crime, commuting and loss of leisure time as well as the value of volunteering and higher education (Lawn, 2014).\nA key insight of the ISEW and GPI identified by Max-Neef (1995) is that beyond a point, per capita GDP stops being correlated with per capita GPI, and additional welfare benefits from GDP growth are limited or negative. While comprehensive in its measurement, GPI has been critiqued on the basis of:\n1.        Not providing a rule by which to determine the sustainability of economic welfare (Neumayer, 1999; Dietz and Neumayer, 2007; Harris, 2007);\n2.        Assuming replacement costs increase over time, which is likely erroneous because, for instance, while replacement of hydrocarbons with renewable technologies e.g. solar might have been more expensive in the past, it has now got cheaper and may continue to do so through innovation; \n3.        Its treatment of the distribution of income which fails to command general agreement; and\n4.        It assuming a compounding or cumulative environmental damage function (Neumayer, 2000) as per Daly and Cobb (1989), the value of which is measured in terms of the opportunity cost of a fund contributed to by the internalized externality of emissions. This has been argued to be an incorrect approach if marginal social cost (MSC) values are used given these already internalize accumulated costs. Removing this feature has actually been shown to negate Max-Neef’s threshold effect (Neumayer, 2000). \n\n\nHuman Development Index\nThe United Nations’ Development Programme’s Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite unweighted indices combining a measure of standard of living, health and education (proxied as per capita GDP, life expectancy at birth, and years of education for an average adult and the Gross Enrollment Index, respectively). The measure normalizes each variable to a scale of between 0-1 and averages across these using the mean (initially arithmetic and then geometric) to produce an annual value for a country. The Inequality-Adjusted measure of HDI goes further by discounting each dimension’s average value according to the inequality of that value within the relevant population (UNDP, 2020). Issues identified with the measure of HDI and its variants include:\n1.        That while it can offer a broader insight into the determinants of human development, it can not necessarily give insight into its sustainability, for which it would need to incorporate a mechanism for accounting for over-exploitation of resources (Sagar and Najam, 1998); and\n2.        HDI assigns weights to certain factors that imply equal trade-offs when these measurements may not always be equally valuable. For example, countries could achieve the same HDI through different combinations of life expectancy and GNI per capita.\n\n\nJones and Klenow’s Wellbeing Index\nJones and Klenow propose an index combining data on consumption with three non-market factors—leisure, excessive inequality, and mortality— to calculate expected lifetime economic benefits for a population over time. The index focusses on consumption rather than income, adding to this the value of leisure (or home production), and subtracting costs related to inequality. These adjustments are made within a utility function (Jones and Klenow, 2016), with consumption weighted heavily within the index. This calculation measured across one year is then multiplied by the average life expectancy within a country to give a measure of average expected lifetime welfare adjusted for consumption, leisure, inequality and life-expectancy. The USA is used as a benchmark (i.e. =1) in the index, with all other countries’ values measured in relation to this. Bannister and Mourmouras (2018) have sought to extend this work to include measures of environmental externalities based on global externality costs of GHGs through assuming a tax is applied to the population proportionate to the externality of global GHGs they emit. This is done in a partial manner by accounting for solely the costs of externalities on consumption, rather than across all measures making up the index such as life expectancy or leisure.\n\n\n\nSubjective Wellbeing Measures\nA rational understanding of welfare might justifiably be argued to need to incorporate subjective perspectives (Doyal and Gough, 1991). Easterlin (1974) observed that within a country, rich people tend to be happier than poor people, but across countries, rich nations tend not to be much happier than poorer ones. Welfare and wellbeing can be understood in objective terms i.e. the circumstances of a person’s life such as income or life expectancy as well as in subjective terms i.e. the personal judgements of these circumstances people have, inclusive of their own perceived happiness and satisfaction. Happiness is a subjective evaluation of those objective circumstances, but with no universally accepted and used definition. This is reflected in the different ways happiness has sought to be measured, for instance:\n1.        Current/remembered reported emotion elicited through questions such as ‘how happy are you right now?’;\n2.        Cognitive life evaluations elicited through questions such as ‘how happy are you with your life as a whole?’;\n3.        Eudaimonic happiness elicited through questions such as ‘does your life have meaning and purpose?’\nThe link between income and subjective wellbeing is complex for reasons including that income is often a ‘positional good’, while people can adapt to increasing income levels. Subjective wellbeing measures have been expanded on within the 2018 HMT Green Book, however problems associated with the subjective wellbeing approach and basing policy on self-reported experienced utility include:\n1.        Potentially flawed assumptions of interpersonal comparability;\n2.        Measurement issues relating to the choice of scales and the influence of moods\n&lt;https://www.lse.ac.uk/PBS/assets/documents/SPCW-WELLBEING-FINAL.pdf&gt;\n\n\nBiophysical Indicators\nBroadly, biophysical indicators as presented here are those which do not incorporate monetary valuation.\n\nMaterial Flows\nModern societies require great quantities of different types of materials, some used in bulk, while others are highly specialized and are used in minute quantities (Hoekstra, 2020). Inspired by the work of Ayres and Knees (1969) on industry metabolism, studies of material flows apply the biological concept of metabolism to human society, utilizing quantitative assessment to describe or analyse these. Such studies generally depart from the view that the sheer scale of humanity’s material use creates environmental problems and needs to be reduced accordingly (Daly, 1992). ‘Resource Flow or Material Flow Analysis (MFA) can be considered as the application of the biological concept of metabolism to human society.’ (Wiedmann et al. 2006). Material flow data is collected on a regular basis across a number of countries in accordance with the Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounting (EW-MFA) framework reflected in the SEEA-CF, meaning figures produced can be consistent with the principles and system boundaries of the SNA. Materials examined in material flow accounts are broadly categorised into biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores.\nIn recent years, awareness of policy makers generally increased regarding the significance not only of materials and products directly used by a national economy, or a regional economy such as the EU, but also of indirect resource use required along supply chains and embodied in internationally traded products. Therefore due to the nature of increasingly complex production supply chains, consumption-based measurement of material flows have become increasingly relevant and more widely developed, often drawing on economic data captured in the SNA as a means of reallocating material extraction. Issues with material flow accounting approaches include:\n1.        Material flow accounting (MFA) generally focusses on flows of material resources, without sufficient consideration for other types of resources e.g. water. The virtual water concept, as an example, expands the remit of inquiry to other types of resources that society uses.\n2.        From an ecological standpoint, an additive approach based purely on weight can be problematic as two forms of material throughput with different environmental profiles cannot meaningfully be compared on the basis of weight just because they can be expressed in that same unit. Environmentally-weighted material consumption (EMC) tries to account for this by using environmental impact coefficients derived from life cycle analysis to weight the unit of each material type by its environmental impacts (van der Vote et al. 2003). Others have sought to translate material extraction into measures of areal extent e.g. Maus et al. (2020).\n\n\nEcological Footprint\n“Footprint” calculations are a technique through which environmental pressures are\nattributed to domestic demand. The ecological footprint reveals the amount of land and water (surface area) that is necessary to produce a certain consumption bundle. The ecological footprint (EF) defines national sustainability in terms of an EF which is either less than nationally available biocapacity, or less than an equal share of global biocapacity when presented on a per capita basis. The vector for comparison between supply and demand is surface area (Ceballos et al. 2005). EF has enjoyed fairly widespread use, being used in UN Development Program Human Development Reports and in Welsh Government sustainability goals, while it has been applied at a range of scales from communities and cities to the globe. The metric builds on earlier measures of the impact of humans on ecosystems such as Vitsouek’s et al.’s (1986) Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP). EF takes a consumption-based approach and is theoretically premised on a ‘strong sustainability’ interpretation by requiring that nations maintain non-declining levels of natural wealth through aligning consumption with planetary constraints (Daly 2005; Wackernagel et al. 2014). Methodologically, a nation’s EF is calculated by converting its populations’ demand for resources and functions including food, energy, and requirements for absorbing waste, into the area of land (global hectares) required to produce these sustainably given current technologies. This demand is then compared to the area of land that a nation actually has for producing those resources (i.e. its biocapacity) or if on a per capita basis, the global hectares available per person, with sustainability seen to arise if areal demand is equal to, or less than, supply. Issues identified with the EF as a measure of sustainable development include:\n1.        The focus of comparison in terms of land area has been critiqued for lacking a biophysical basis in terms of understanding of thresholds (Blomqvist et al. 2013);\n2.        It has been critiqued for lacking a socioeconomic dimension, though this might be justified given that the indicator foremostly defines economic sustainability in terms of adherence to environmental limits. To incorporate socioeconomic content, some authors e.g. Moran et al. (2008) have proposed looking at the Human Development Index and EF side-by-side, and requiring, for instance, that for a country to be sustainable that it’s EF is no greater than biocapacity and HDI no less than 0.8;\n3.        Empirically, the conversion to land area of various environmental demand has been critiqued in some instances. For instance, energy consumption has taken up half of the global EF, but this is contested e.g. due to a variable treatment of nuclear energy through time (Ayres, 2000);\n4.        EF’s aggregation of factors controlled by different policy areas can arguably provide limited signals as to where policy effort should most effectively be deployed to enhance societal sustainability, though some policy prescriptions can be teased from the indicator e.g. reducing consumption demands and increasing land efficiency; and\n5.        Methodologically, aggregation flaws arise by applying the same average biocapacity yield for resources globally, such that a nation may incorrectly be shown to be overshooting biocapacity if its yields for a given resource are greater than average (Van Kooten and Bulte 2000).\n\n\nPlanetary Boundaries\nThe ‘planetary boundaries’ (PB) concept (Rockstrom et al. 2009) precursored by Opschoor’s (1987) concept of ‘environmental space’ is an attempt to identify what a safe level of environmental use might be based on the view that at any point in time, there are limits to the degree of environmental pressure the Earth’s ecosystems can withstand without irreversible damage to these and the life supporting processes they support. The PB concept is grounded in the view that some natural capital components measured in terms of regulating services are non-substitutable. The underlying message of the metric is to remain within these boundaries so as to not overstep tipping points, though translation into management targets is required (Bringezu, 2019).\n&lt;https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/is-europe-living-within-the-planets-limits&gt;\n\n\n\nHybrid Indicators\n\nSustainability Gaps\nHueting’s (1980) ‘Sustainable National Income’ (SNI) attempts to adjust national income for the technical and structural costs of meeting strong sustainability standards as well as defensive expenditures. A prerequisite is to establish states of ecosystem which maintain vital environmental functions. The ‘Sustainability Gap’ then refers to the difference between observed states of the environment or pressures causing natural capital assets to be at that non-optimal level and that threshold level consistent with strong sustainability (Ekins and Simon 1999). The gap can be expressed in physical or monetary terms and reflects the level of reinvestment and change an economy needs to make to maintain, protect and restore ecosystems to the level required by society. Ekins and Simon in extending this work advise against calculating SNI using monetary valuation of the degree of change in the economy over time to reach sustainable levels of resource use due to significant non-marginal price changes (Dietz and Neumayer, 2007).\n\n\n‘Doughnut’ economics\nRaworth’s ‘doughnut’ (2017) has been proposed as a dashboard approach measuring national and global sustainability based on meeting human needs within the ‘planetary boundaries’ defined by Rockstrom et al. (2009). A ‘just and safe’ level of development is understood as the space between two concentric circles, the outer extent of which represents PB’s that should not be surpassed given known assimilative and regenerative capacities, uncertainty and precaution, and the inner circle of which represents satisfying human needs as codified in the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\nGross Ecosystem Product\nGross Ecosystem Product (GEP) seeks to measure the total value of final ecosystem goods and services supplied to people in a given region annually (Ouyang et al. 2020). It brings together an assessment of biophysical production values of ecosystem goods and final services (regulating and cultural services, with supporting services implicitly valued (Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007) through physical accounting based on SEEA-EEA, with ecosystem service pricing based on market and non-market valuation to quantify, in monetary terms, the flow of services from ecosystems in a given period. Such an approach is valuable as ecosystems provide a crucial source of welfare to those marginally engaged in markets as well as to people in ways outside of the market e.g. via non-exchanged amenity values (Vedeld et al. 2004). GEP can be written as:\nWhere EPV is the economic value of ecosystem provision, ERV that of regulating services and ECV that of cultural services.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring Resource Use\nThere are a range of methodologies available for analysing material flows, the choice of which will affect final estimates. The most widely established methodological framework for measuring material resource flows at a national level is the Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounting (EW-MFA) system (Eurostat, 2018) which underpins the SNA SEEA Material Flow Accounts (SNA-SEEA-MFA). The system seeks to standardise how material inputs to the economy, net additions of materials to stocks and outflows (disposal of waste and emissions and exports) are measured by national statistics offices in accordance with the mass balance principle (conservation of mass principle).\n&lt;http://sciencesearch.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=0&ProjectID=14064&gt;\n\nIndicators\nIn a closed economy or at the global level, the sum of domestic resource extraction (DE) is equivalent to consumption-based material flow indicators such as domestic material consumption (DMC)[7] or raw material consumption (RMC) as well as their equivalent input-based indicators e.g., direct material input (DMI)[8] and Raw Material Input (RMI) as all trade flows net out.\nThe indicators total material consumption (TMC) and Total Material Requirement (TMR)[9] expands the system accounting boundary by including unused flows. Input indicators illustrate all material inputs to the domestic economy, independent of whether products are consumed domestically or exported. As a result, these are not additive across countries in the manner consumption-based figures are, which conversely exclude the materials embedded in exports from a country.\nGenerally speaking, the broader the scope of the measure, the higher the potential uncertainty in the figures. EW-MFA consumption and input indicators track the same material resource flows which are categorised at a high level into biomass, metallic and non-metallic mineral resources and fossil fuels.\n\nDomestic Material Consumption\nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a headline indicator derived from the EW-MFA and SEEA-CF-MFA systems. It is currently the most widely used material flow-based indicator at the core of national statistical reporting on material flows. DMC is calculated by summing the used fraction of domestically extracted and harvested materials and the weight of imported raw materials, semi-finished and manufactured products, while excluding the weight of exported raw materials, semi-finished and manufactured products.\nDMC can therefore be written as:\nWhere DE is domestic extraction and PtB defines the physical trade balance of Im i.e. imports and Ex i.e. exports. DMC excludes hidden flows throughout. A closely linked indicator, Direct Material Input (DMI) is based on the same methodology but incorporates the materials mobilised or used in the production of exported goods and services (OECD, 2008).\nBoth DMI and DMC are weighted towards resource use activities within national boundaries and in that sense are more akin to ‘production’ oriented economic measures and similar to the manner in which UNFCCC accounting is undertaken for greenhouse gas emissions.\nKey benefits of DMC and DMI include that their underlying methodologies are well documented, with national and official statistics largely drawn on in their compilation. This makes the compilation of their figures relatively transparent. The accuracy of these measures is also thought to be relatively high. A key issue with both indicators is referred to a problem of ‘asymmetry’. That is, the weight of the traded components of material flows are based on the weight of goods crossing the border rather than the weight of raw materials used to produce those goods, contrasting with the treatment of domestic extraction. Where goods crossing the border are raw materials, this doesn’t immediately pose an issue, however where the goods crossing borders through trade are finished or semi-finished products, this means there is a risk of systematic underestimation of the quantity of raw material extraction required to satisfy demand for import-intensive countries.\n\n\nRaw Material Consumption\nTo capture the environmental implications of trade and increasingly globalised value chains, consumption-based accounting has sought to complement traditional production-based accounting (Peters and Hertwich, 2008). Like DMC, indicators of raw material consumption (RMC) seek to measure domestic used material extraction, but in addition, also the full upstream used material extraction associated with the production of imports along their supply chains. Similarly to DMC, it excludes hidden flows throughout. Raw material input (RMI) is based on the same methodology but incorporates the raw materials mobilised or used in the production of exported goods and services.\nA key benefit of using RMC over DMC is that it looks to measure both the weight of domestic extraction and overseas raw material extraction associated with the production of imports on an equal basis, rather than measuring imports based on the weight of materials and finished products crossing national borders. This is increasingly useful given the growth of complex international supply chains due to processes of specialization and cost-reduction seeking. By attempting to account for the indirect raw material ‘rucksack’ associated with imports, RMC and RMI may be subject to higher levels of uncertainty than indicators which focus on measuring materials directly used within the economy.\nWhile there is ongoing work to harmonize methodologies for measuring RMC at an international level, the United Nations (UN) SNA-SEEA 2012 ‘Applications and Extensions’ handbook states ’consumption-based indicators should be based on data and relationships contained in input-output tables; ideally…multiregional input-output tables should be used’ (page. 17).\n\n\n\n\nCoefficient Based Method\nA method for estimating RMC developed by Eurostat works by applying ‘raw material equivalents’ (RME) to monetary import and export data using coefficients. In the context of EW-MFA, this approach was initially developed by the Wuppertal Institute in the 1990s. The approach can be written as:\nWhere RME refers to the raw material equivalents applied to each trade-related element of the formula and underlying elements are those which feed into a measure of national DMC. The material coefficients applied to the traded elements have been calculated using data from input-output tables, domestic extraction data from MFA and life-cycle-inventories. While an improvement over DMC by attempting to resolve the asymmetrical treatment between domestic extraction and traded components, the coefficient method struggles to accurately quantify materials associated with re-imported goods that cross borders several times, can have truncation errors (by not capturing the whole complexity of production chains so certain up-stream chains have to be “cut off”. introduced when the full material supply chain is not accounted for, while conversion factors can be sourced from various years making inter-temporal comparison difficult (Owen, Giesekam and Barrett, 2017). This method has been applied to estimating UK-level RMC for approaching a decade (Defra, 2011).\n\nMulti-Regional Input-Output Approach[LO6] \nNAMEA\nWiedmann et al. (2015) [4] defined the RMC as the “global allocation of used raw material extraction to the final demand of an economy . . .  which does not record the actual physical movement of materials within and among countries but, instead, enumerates the link between the beginning of a production chain (where raw materials are extracted from the natural environment) and its end (where a product or service is consumed)” (p. 6271).\nInput-output economics was founded by the Russian-American economist Wassily Leontief (1936). Input-Output Analysis (IOA) play a central role in helping industrial ecologists understand which components of socioeconomic systems contribute to the extraction, transformation, use, and discard of natural resources to produce, reproduce, and operate their biophysical structures (Wiedland et al. 2019). An Environmentally-Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output Table (EEMRIOT) table is an integrated dataset that combines two elements: a monetary input-output table (MIOT) representing monetary inter-industry flows and final demand, and an extension table in physical units depicting environmental flows associated with those economic activities (Wiedland et al. 2019). One of the key data requirements for this approach is therefore national input-output tables which underpin the production of headline economic indicators such as GDP and are collected in accordance with the SNA. Another is the material flow accounts collected by countries in accordance with SNA-SEEA-CF guidance.\nA method for calculating RMC has been developed by the University of Leeds (UoL) on behalf of Defra since 2017 and builds on a similar methodology for estimating the UK carbon footprint developed since 2008 (Barrett, Owen and Sakai, 2011). It involves reallocating domestic extraction (as calculated through the SEEA and EW-MFA accounting system) by country and world region at a 15 category disaggregation, to final demand in the UK in a given year using a MRIO database underpinned by supply and use tables (SUTs)[10] produced by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and input-output tables compiled within the EXIOBASE MRIO database for trade data sourced from US COMTRADE alongside separate sources for material extensions. This approach usefully covers the whole economy in a systematic way, thereby avoiding truncation errors and double counting as different supply-chains are clearly distinguished from each other in the monetary input-output tables and allows for material inputs to re-imported goods to be more accurately measured. The methodology is extremely data intensive, requiring regular information on material extraction, production structures and international trade relations of trade partners (Eisenmenger et al. 2016). Eisenmenger et al. (2016) compared calculations of Austrian RMC for the year 2007 using 7 different approaches, with 4 of these MRIO and 3 hybrid life-cycle analysis-IO approaches. Results diverged significantly, with the spread of results between 21t/cap and 33 t/cap.\n\n\nTotal Material Consumption\nTotal material consumption (TMC) and its input-based equivalent, total material requirement (TMR) are metrics which expand the system boundaries of DMC and RMC to account for both used and unused extraction within a country in addition to used and unused extraction associated with upstream production activities associated with domestic consumption. Unused extraction includes the likes of mining overburden and bycatch from fishing. This measure is the most comprehensive out of those presented and viewed as most representative of overall environmental pressure (Lutter and Giljum, 2014; Kovanda, 2020), though is also associated with greatest uncertainty. TMR was calculated for the UK as part of the ONS Environmental Accounts up to 2013 (ONS, 2013).\n\n\nComparing available resource use measures\nSome general strengths and weaknesses for each measure of resource use currently tracked on a regular basis at a UK-level are set out in the table below.\n\n\n\nMeasuring Resource Productivity/Intensity\n“Intensity indicators compare trends in economic activity such as value-added, income or consumption with trends in specific environmental flows such as emissions, energy and water use, and flows of waste. These indicators are expressed as either intensity or productivity ratios, where intensity indicators are calculated as the ratio of the environmental flow to the measure of economic activity, and productivity indicators are the inverse of this ratio.” (SEEA-Environment Extensions, 2012, pg. 13).\nBoth can be used to indicate decoupling, but conceptually different (productivity focussed on maximisation, efficiency focussed on the right level) and differ in their emphasis.\nAt its most basic, a measure of efficiency or productivity tells us about a relationship in terms of scale between an output and an input. Singular measures of resource efficiency/productivity (as opposite to combined measures e.g. total factor productivity) generally seek to track the effectiveness with which an economy or sub-national process uses resource inputs to generate material or service outputs or anthropocentric value of some description.\nAllocative efficiency is a state of the economy in which production is aligned with consumer preferences; in particular, every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the marginal cost of producing.\nResource efficiency and productivity can be defined with respect to (OECD, 2008):\n•         Physical or technical efficiency i.e. the quantity of a physical output in relation to a unit of resource input, with both expressed in physical terms (e.g. tonnes of crude steel produced in relation to a tonne of iron ore inputs). These may be desired outputs e.g. floor area or usable products or undesired outputs e.g. waste; (process level)\n•         Service efficiency i.e. the quantity of a service or function e.g. km travelled per mass unit of material resource inputs for providing that service or function (MIPS); (meso-level)\n•         Economic efficiency/productivity i.e. the money value of resources outputs relative to the money value of resource input(s) from either a cost-minimisation or benefit-maximization perspective; (process, meso and macro level)\n•         Economic-physical productivity i.e. the money value of outputs per mass unit of material resource inputs. (macro level).\n–         ‘Many authors treat both productivity and efficiency as the ratio between output and input, not indicating any difference between the two concepts (Sengupta 1995; Cooper et al. 2000). We define efficiency as the distance measure, that is, the difference between the actual ratio of inputs and outputs and the best possible combination of them. Efficiency and productivity, in any case, remain complementary concepts. Measures of efficiency are more accurate than those of productivity, as they involve a comparison with the most efficient combination, whereas productivity is based solely on the ratio of outputs to inputs (Daraio and Simar, 2007).’ (Toma, Massari and Miglietta, 2016). - At a macro-level linked to the notion of allocative efficiency.\nOther more complex multifaceted definitions: ‘’resource efficient development (…) allows the economy to create more with less, delivering greater value with less input, using resources in a sustainable way and minimising their impacts on the environment.’\nAt a national level, intensity indicators related to resource use are generally constructed by relating aggregate national economic output or value added to flow measures of resource input, both for the same time period, and are often presented as macro-economic concepts alongside labour or capital productivity (OECD, 2008). Tracking such a measure can help give insight into whether a country is decoupling economic output from resource use in a given year.\n‘Utilization of data on environmental flows. Commonly, information on environmental flows will not be strictly aligned to the measurement boundaries of the SEEA. Care should therefore be taken to record appropriately, with adjustment as necessary, entries for purchases abroad by tourists and re-exports. Careful attention should also be paid to the general issue of recording data on a residence basis rather than on a territory basis (see the SEEA Central Framework sect. 3.3, for details).’ - MFA calculated on a territorial basis I think, while GDP on a residency basis\n\nConsiderations around Indicator Structure\nFor efficiency measures related to resource use, an indicator can either be structured as a ratio with material use a denominator and value output a numerator such as with resource productivity, or alternatively structured with material use as a numerator and a measure of output as a denominator such as with resource efficiency. There are differences in emphasis and connotations between these two presentations. While productivity is frequently presented as a ratio, translating resource use into monetary terms based on foregone future values and current and future environmental damages in monetary terms, would allow for a measure of productivity derived through subtracting costs from aggregate output. Such an approach might align more closely with economic theory and weight material consumption impacts in welfare terms.\n\n\nPossible Output Indicator for an Efficiency Target\nAn output indicator component of a resource-related efficiency measure might be selected to represent:\n1.        A desired output the indicator developer perceives society should be pursuing; or\n2.        Something that is currently pursued in society and which the indicator developer wishes to see a decoupling of resource demands from.\nThere is a fundamental question in an efficiency measure regarding whether we are trying to actively steer society through both the denominator and numerator. It is also important to consider statistical coherence between the output and input measure, i.e. the degree to which they are logically connected and mutually consistent. While GDP includes final domestic demand and revenues from net exports in monetary terms, DMC includes domestic extraction and physical-net imports, reflecting that trade in materials and money, move in opposite directions (Eisenberger et al. 2016).\nThis chapter has identified some of the issues associated with GDP as a measure of economic welfare and wellbeing more generally, as well as some of the reasons it has remained so prominent as a metric guiding society over the last century. This prominence, even in the context of significant criticism of the metric may be a basis for justifying its use as an output metric within a measure of resource productivity. Using a headline measure of the SNA such as GDP which is widely recognised and pursued even if undesirable in some regards, accepts that society is pursuing this but nevertheless says, you can only continue to pursue this if you decouple it from resource use. There is a risk around whether incorporating a measure such as GDP may lead to redundancy in the metric over time if GDP becomes less of a focus over time for society. We might alternatively wish to use a measure we view as a more desirable output or outcome, but there might be some issues with this.\nThe output indicator, where relevant, can be normalised e.g. GDP placed on a per capita basis (usually taken as the standard of living), with median rather than average values used to potentially better account for distribution, or GDP adjusted based on a measure of inequality such as the Gini Coefficient and as included in the measure of HDI, though there are concerns with such an approach too e.g. Nolan (2019).\n\n\n\nAn Absolute vs. Efficiency Target\nSome of the pros and cons of resource-use related targets levied in absolute terms e.g. a reduction in tonnages by a given date compared to efficiency targets e.g. a reduction in the material intensity (per capita or per unit of output) is given.\n\n\n\nAbsolute\nEfficiency\n\n\n•         Gives more certainty regarding outcome\n•         Has the potential to still deliver improvements in resource productivity but while ensuring absolute decoupling\n•         Focus on decoupling of welfare from resource use. Increases in productivity are a precondition for saving resources without reducing the standard of living of people\n•         May allow us to hedge our bets as we work out how to decouple welfare from resource use and the indicator stabilises.\n\n\n•         Could limit achievement of other key environmental targets e.g. net zero\n•         There is uncertainty around the optimal level of resource use to reach. Notwithstanding the significant uncertainty associated with such estimates, several authors have sought to define what an acceptable level of material extraction globally might be, variously accounting for the potential resource and waste-related environmental limits. Dittrich et al. (2012), for instance, suggest that global material extraction should not exceed 50 Gt y-1, about half the level evident today and equating to a global per capita limit of 8 tonnes y-1 by 2030. This level was echoed in a separate analysis by Hoekstra and Wiedmann (2014) and Mont et al. (2013) in O’Neill et al. 2018. UNEP’s International Resource Panel (IRP) recommends a per capita target of between 6 and 8 tonnes y-1 by 2050 (2014). Bringenzu (2015) based on a higher population growth projection than that used in the IRP study, suggests a per capita target value of 5 tonnes for the year 2050, with a range of 3-6 tonnes (based on returning to year 2000 material use of 50.8 Gt).\n            Bringezu (2019) – it has been suggested to limit the cropland required for final consumption of agricultural goods to 0.20 ha/person in 2030, corresponding to 0.16 ha/person in 2050 in order to halt the loss of global biodiversity by land use change.\n•         Potential for significant welfare impacts\n•         Policies that improve resource efficiency might be able to achieve decoupling, but higher resource efficiency might also boost economic growth and resource consumption as it shifts the macroeconomic production frontier and increases consumer income.\n•         Of the 27 EU Member States whose resource productivity improved between 2000 and 2017, 12 have experienced an increase in demand for materials over the same period. In some cases, the increase was substantial: Malta 71 %, Estonia 70 %, Lithuania 63 %, Bulgaria 46 %, Luxembourg 34 %, Poland 33 %, Slovakia 32 % and Sweden 31 %. In general, policies and targets for reducing overall material use are far less common than those aimed at increasing resource productivity (EEA, 2018)\n•         Rebound effects - Economic theory shows that growth occurs when an economy becomes more efficient, in the sense that production processes require fewer resources to achieve the same or greater levels of output. In the long run, these “productivity” improvements lead to increases in national income which are used for purposes such as buying products or services, or investing in natural capital. Uncertainty in the level of resource use it will deliver even if the target is met. Technological progress can and does raise resource productivity. But for larger systems under conditions of economic growth and stable (or even declining) resource prices usually rebound effects occur that (out)balance those productivity gains – thus the resource use of the larger system, despite resource productivity gains, remains the same or even rises. (Alcott 2005; Ayres et al. 2007; Binswanger 2001; Holm and Englund 2009; see: Jevon’ s paradox: Polimeni and Alcott 2008).’\n•         However increases in growth are not unbounded (can only go as high as the costs of resources)\n•         “If GDP increases at a quicker pace than resource consumption, then mechanically GDP/DMC increases. This would be considered as a progress. But European resource consumption could still increase in absolute terms (way beyond what is sustainable), which would be a failure. Therefore such an aggregated indicator would hide a negative trend for the absolute resource consumption of Europe – which is THE main sustainability issue.” (WWF, 2012)\n\n\n\nBringezu (2015) argues that material flow related targets should be based on the perspective of a future metabolic system that can operate within the global bio-geo-sphere for centuries to come, and this therefore implies the need for an understanding of the implications of material flows for the bio-geo-sphere and limits to these within understood thresholds. Beyond the general prescription that current levels of primary material use in industrialised countries is likely greater than a sustainable level, quantifying more precisely what a ‘sustainable’ level of resource use might look like has proven difficult. The environmental science around resource use is currently far weaker than that associated with the climate and it therefore remains difficult to say with any degree of certainty, what might constitute a ‘sustainable level of resource use’ (Bleischwitz, ). Complicating the matter is the fact that environmental impacts vary by material type, and thus not only overall tonnages but also the composition of material use must be considered (unlike for globally intermixing gasses such as carbon dioxide), while in addition, the environmental intensity of resource use can be moderated by technologies of extraction and production which may improve with time. Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2010) argue that ’even if estimates of capacity limits are uncertain and some degree of substitution and capacity expansion is assumed, by many measures humanity has already exceeded environmental carrying capacity.\nNew report published as part of 2 year programme on Circular Economy Taskforce entitled ‘why the UK needs a new vision for resource use’. Pushing for a halving of resource use by 2050. Argues for needing a clear vision on: 1) incentives; 2) products; 3) behaviours; 4) business models; 5) logistics; and 6) infrastructure similar to carbon management. For carbon, there is a clear vision, budgets, legally binding targets and input from the CCC. Argues that the following is needed: 1) Target for cutting resource use; 2) Plans for specific sectors and materials; and 3) Binding interim goals"

    "text": "Gross Domestic Product\nThe historical roots of national accounting span back to determining the tax base of nations in the times of the Domesday Book (1085-86) and possibly earlier. Petty (1665) and King (1695) produced some of the first estimates of national income in Europe (Maddison, 2003; Vanoli, 2016). However, such estimates were produced intermittently and in a largely unstandardised way. National accounting in its modern-day form was introduced from the 1920s, pioneered by Kuznets in the USA and Clark in the UK to support macroeconomic policy aimed at mobilizing economic resources following the Great Depression and leading into World War 2. The System of National Accounts (SNA) - an internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity - was introduced by the United Nations (UN) in the 1950s to support international comparability of the statistics countries were collecting. Most countries now compile statistics about their economy in accordance with the UN-SNA which represents a rigorous accounting framework (Malinvaud, 1973).\nGross domestic product (GDP) ‘combines into a single figure…[the monetary value of] the [market] output…carried out by all the firms, non-profit institutions, government bodies and households in a given territory during a given period, provided that the production takes place within the country’s economic territory’ (OECD, 2014, p.15). GDP is a headline measure of the SNA and the most widely used metric for measuring national economic development at present.[1] Reference to economic growth today is generally in reference to the level of output in an economy relative to prior years as measured by inflation-adjusted GDP. Growth in GDP is frequently an implicit, if not explicit, target that national governments subscribe to.\nEconomic value can be understood as being created through production activities, with ‘value added’ what remains after the costs of production are accounted for, from which income e.g. wages or share dividends is derived. This income is then either spent or saved as financial or non-financial assets and in some cases re-lent back into the economy. Under the production approach, GDP at market prices is equivalent to national gross value added (GVA) - which is a measure of the increase in the value of the economy due to the production of goods and services - plus taxes and less subsidies, as so:\nWhere VA refers to value added across all firms, t is tax and s is subsidies. As a sum of expenditures on final goods and services by final users, GDP can alternatively be written as:\nWhere C is consumption (or expenditure in the economy on things the National Accounts categorises as consumption), I is investment (expenditure on domestic investment), G is expenditure by Government, X is the monetary value of exports and M, that of imports. GDP can lastly be calculated under the income approach, as the sum of primary and secondary income, compensation of employees and taxes and subsidies.\nEconomic production involves the variably consumptive conversion of production factors or capital stocks into income. Conceptually, economic welfare broadly constitutes the difference between the benefits and costs of such economic activity (Lawn, 2014). Economic growth as measured by change in GDP can be argued to be associated with an expansion in opportunities for material welfare given higher purchasing power and correlation with employment, thereby allowing people to: 1) buy goods and services providing welfare directly; and 2) pay taxes, enabling the state to provide public goods. The use of GDP as a proxy of economic welfare and for guiding societal development therefore has some key benefits, including a fit with the economic definition of preference satisfaction through consumption and the correlation that exists between per capita GDP and certain socially desirable outcomes such as reduced infant mortality and increased life expectancy.\nThere are nevertheless several significant issues with the use of GDP as an effective indicator of societal development by itself. Kuznets himself recognised this, famously saying ‘the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income’ (1934). Issues with GDP identified include:\n1.        Using market prices as an indication of economic welfare is hampered by price distortions arising from monopoly, taxation, poor information and market imperfections;\n2.        The reliance on market prices and therefore on tracking market transactions means that many welfare benefits are overlooked altogether e.g. non-marketed household production, leisure or volunteer services which don’t lead to the production of goods. GDP therefore can be seen to represent a narrow conception of welfare;\n3.        The national accounts may mismeasure nominal GDP arising from new services such as those linked to the digital economy and not capture consumer surplus associated with such new services and quality-improved goods and services very effectively (Dynan and Sheiner, 2018);\n4.        GDP is not able to distinguish between production activities which contribute to economic welfare and those that reduce it, with the result being that economic income is not always correlated with economic welfare at a societal level;\n5.        As a ‘gross’ measure, GDP does not account for depreciation in underlying capital stocks on which economic activity is reliant. An insensitivity to depreciation in capital assets (whether produced or natural) which are central to long-term income, means GDP is poorly suited to telling us about the likely sustainability of income flows in the long-run. Indeed, focusing on maximizing GDP in the short-term can actually provide an incentive to deplete the capital stocks which underpin future human income as current returns are not considered alongside the opportunity cost to future output[2] (Dynan and Sheiner, 2018);\n6.        Aggregate measures of the national accounts such as GDP or the widely used measure of GDP per capita, do not provide insight into the distribution of income across society and may give an inaccurate picture of average welfare if income is unequally distributed.\nThere has been some disagreement at the margins around whether the use of GDP as a headline metric for economic development is warranted, with some commentators supporting the use of Gross National Income (GNI) instead on the basis of it providing an improved indicator of the monetary resources actually available to those who live in a country, while others support the use of Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) as a better indicator of the money actually available for consumption and saving activities. GNDI also includes both net factor income (captured by the GNI) as well as unilateral transfers, making it particularly relevant as a measure of interest for developing countries (Capelli and Vaggi, 2013).\nGiven the perceived breadth of issues identified with GDP however, some of which are outlined above, and galvanised at an international level by the 1992 Earth Summit, there has been a push to develop quite significantly different measures of societal development altogether to GDP.\nStiglitz, Sen and Fitoussi (2009) in a seminal review undertaken at the request of the then President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, argued that society not only needs to be steered by a more comprehensive measure of economic and societal progress than GDP, but also that no single composite measure could summarize something as complex as the magnitude and sustainability of the welfare of members of society. The review instead proposes countries use a dashboard of indicators which:\n1.        Expand the measure of human welfare to cover material welfare, health, education & knowledge, quality of personal activities including work, degree of involvement in political & social life and environmental quality. Expanded welfare measures generally look to capture and track contributions to human wellbeing outside of economic income e.g. health or education without the benefits of these necessarily needing to be captured within increased output or income;\n2.        Incorporate a measure of income distribution e.g. using median rather than mean incomes; and\n3.        Measure change in underpinning capital stocks e.g. natural, built and human capital on which welfare is reliant.\nWe outline just a few of the many alternative measures to GDP which have been proposed below. These are broadly arranged into those seeking to alter or augment the SNA and its headline measures in some way, and those proposed largely outside of the SNA.\n\nDevelopments within the System for National Accounts\nIncorporating information on natural assets into standard accounting frameworks is argued to be essential by some in order to mainstream environmental information and broaden the evidence base for economic decisions (Obst and Vardon, 2014; Solow, 1993). Since the 1980s, the SNA has been augmented in two main ways to attempt to account for sustainability concerns (Spash, 2000):\n1.        By expanding the national accounts to include environmental data sets through Satellite Accounts; and\n2.        By seeking to correct SNA aggregate measures such as GDP to take fuller account of the depletion of natural resources and the deterioration of environmental functions.\n\nIndicators supplementing GDP\n\n\nCapital accounting[3]\nGDP and other aggregate indicators of the national accounts are flow rather than wealth measures. National accounts are increasingly composed of balance sheets. Hamilton and Naikal (2014) categorise total societal wealth into produced, natural and intangible capital, with the latter an aggregate including human, social and institutional capital, generally calculated as a residual in assessments of wealth after the value of other inputs are accounted for. The World Bank (2010) find tangible assets only account for a relatively small proportion of total wealth (in money value) across all countries while intangible assets make up 60-80% of wealth across countries. Types of capital stocks include:\n•         Natural capital - The stock of renewable and non-renewable elements of the natural world (e.g. plants, animals, air, water, soils, minerals) that separately or in combination, yield a flow of benefits (use, option and non-use values) to people, and which can otherwise be depreciated by pollution and overuse, conserved and invested in through restoration. Ecological landscapes are the ‘basic unit of most ecological processes and the goods and services derived from them’ (Barbier 2015, p.26). The derivation of value from the natural world often relies on other types of capital for transformation into goods and services;\n•         Built capital - Material goods or fixed assets e.g. buildings, infrastructure and machinery which contribute to the production process rather than being the output itself e.g. tools, machines, buildings (the SNA already measured change in these assets);\n•         Human capital - The human capacities to transform tangible assets into outputs through endowments of education, specific knowledge and the wider abilities and qualities of people that make them productive (Becker; Dawson & Martin, 2015). Julian Simon, for example, argued the ultimate resource was the human mind;\n•         Social and institutional capital - Factors such as the quality of institutions, rule of law, governance, and the relationships between people in the form of networks, norms and trust which work to lower transaction costs and support innovation (Maskell, 2002);\n•         Health capital - Arrow et al. (2010) find the value of “health capital” is significant relative to other forms of capital, however this is generally not a category reflected widely in studies of wealth; and\n•         Financial capital - Used as a store of value and enabler of exchange. The most fungible form of capital and often an essential enabler of production alongside those other forms of capital outlined, though only as valuable as shared perceptions of its worth.\nTo better account for changes in natural capital and economic-environment relations, the SNA was added to by the satellite UN System of Environmental-Economic Accounts-Central Framework (SEEA-CF) in 2012, which consists of:\n1.        Asset Accounts – estimating the physical and monetary value of stocks of natural resources;\n2.        Physical Flow Accounts – showing how the environment contributes to the economy via physical flows e.g. through the extraction of raw materials as captured in the Environmental Accounts, the impacts that the economy has on the environment for instance through air emissions as captured in the Atmospheric Emissions Accounts and other residual flows e.g. solid waste.; and\n3.        Environmental-Activity Accounts - showing how society responds to environmental issues through environmental protection e.g. taxation and resource management expenditures. When such tax data is combined with physical data at a national or industry level, it is possible to see whether increasing taxes has an effect on environmental performance over time.\nThe SEEA-CF physical flow accounts are consistent with the economic flows data produced by the SNA, making it possible to link economic developments e.g. output and value added, to natural resource inputs and generation of residuals as well as expenditure data (Hoekstra, 2020).\nThe SEEA-CF focusses on environmental flows that are separable. To consider more systemic changes in ecosystem conditions, the SEEA-CF was added to by the SEEA-Experimental Ecosystem Accounts (SEEA-EEA) in 2013. The SEEA-EEA provide a spatially explicit approach to quantifying changes in ecosystems through GIS mapping of the extent and condition of ecosystems. The modelling tool ARIES have been developed to lower the barriers to compiling these complicated datasets via tools such as machine reasoning.\nNatural Capital Accounts (NCA) differ to the Environmental Accounts (EA) by summarising the physical annual flows of services provided by the natural environment rather than the pressures placed on the environment. In some instances, the two accounts mirror one another e.g. in the case of oil extraction, the use of these as an input into economic activities recorded in the EA equals the supply of provisioning services of oil from natural capital as recorded in the NCA. In other cases however, the relationship is not as direct (Bright et al. 2019). The NCA also attempts to track the waste remediation services that nature provides to people in the UK e.g. via the sequestration of pollution as well as flows of cultural services derived by people.\nWith significant developments in the SEEA and SEEA-EEA in the last decade, the technical push to develop natural capital accounts has proceeded largely independent of the pull of policy makers for a long time, however increasingly, barriers to considering environmental factors through the SNA is not a wholesale lack of data but rather the lack of awareness of available data and mainstreaming of this as a means of assessing policy questions (Vardon, Burnett and Dovers, 2016). Valuation of assets is largely done on a domestic basis, however there is a place for the further development in linking degradation of natural capital assets to consumptive pressures (Argawala, 2019), as has been done for consumption-based emissions and material flow accounting (e.g. Owen et al. 2020).\nThe Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI) most recently put forward in the Dasgupta Review (2021), proposes that countries track the aggregate value of all capital assets as a better indication of economic progress than GDP, with increases in inclusive wealth indicating an improved productive base capable of supporting living standards into the future, and decreasing values, the opposite. The weak sustainability grounding of the indicator through its implicit acceptance of growth in non-natural capital being able to offset losses in natural capital is illustrated in the findings of the 2012 Inclusive Wealth Report, which suggested that across the twenty countries measured using the IWI, human capital growth was found to offset declines in natural capital, while technological innovation and oil capital gains outweighed declines in other natural capital and damage from climate change.\nA growing number of countries have developed expanded national balance sheets, though issues with the natural capital accounts compiled by national governments include:\n1.        Accounts in their current form are incomplete and thus limited by a lack of comprehensiveness e.g. omitting the value of soils and biodiversity, which is to a large extent due to disagreement over methodologies for measuring such assets but also data gaps; and\n2.        Monetary valuation of stocks are highly influenced by anticipated future values which are generally based on current rents. These valuations can therefore be subject to significant volatility depending on changes in the market, and ultimately human perception.[4]\n\n\nIndicators adjusting GDP\n\n\nGenuine Savings\nAs an example of a adjusted aggregate indicator, the measure of ‘genuine savings’ (GS) developed by Pearce and Atkinson (1993) attempts to link wealth accounting to flow measures of savings within the SNA, building on the stock-flow view of the economy found in Fisher (1911), Hicks (1939) and Samuelson (1961). The metric effectively incorporates an empirical expression of the Hartwick Rule and is thus grounded in weak sustainability theoretics. GS, otherwise referred to as ‘adjusted net savings’ within the UN Central Framework as well as by the World Bank, is an attempt to build on, but redefine, the methodology of ‘adjusted net national income’ (ANNI). ANNI itself modifies ‘net national income’ (NNI) (i.e. ‘gross national income’ (GNI) adjusted for consumption of fixed capital[5]) to further account for depreciation in natural capital[6] to estimate the income available for current consumption or alternatively investment to support future consumption.\nGS as a savings rather than income measure, alternatively adds to a country’s gross savings its educational expenditures and subtracts from this the value of fixed capital depreciation, natural resource depletion for a variety of resources and some pollution-damage costs. GS is presented as a percentage of GNI, with a negative GS representing a nation unsustainably drawing down its wealth by saving insufficiently, thereby impinging on the potential for future welfare. GS can be written in notation as:\n\n\nWhere GrS is ‘gross savings’ i.e. GDP minus consumption expenditure, from which depreciation in produced capital (PC) is subtracted to arrive at ‘net savings’, added to which is the change in human capital (HC) proxied by educational expenditure. Following this, a subtraction of the depletion of non-renewable resources (energy and materials) (NR) and net deforestation (ND) is undertaken to arrive at ‘depletion adjusted savings’, with a final further subtraction of damages from CO2 and particulate matter (D) made to estimate GS.\nWhen interpreting the indicator, if GS &lt; 0, then development is deemed unsustainable. The indicator therefore guides a country to either reduce levels of capital consumption or increase capital investment to the point where GS equals 0 or greater. GS has been evidenced in several assessments as robust, for instance, historically co-integrating with future consumption in the US, Britain and Germany (Hanley et al. 2016), though not across all studies (Ferreira and Vincent, 2005; Pezzey et al. 2006). Issues nevertheless identified include that GS:\n1.        Is ‘one sided’, in that it can only reliably highly the occurrence of negative environmental performance because a non-negative GS might not guarantee sustainability if GS has been persistently negative in the past (Asheim 1994; Pezzey and Withagen, 1995);\n2.        By bringing different types of capital stocks into the same measure and permitting an increase in one capital stock e.g. human capital to offset reductions in natural capital, biophysical limits to substitution seen by others as central to national sustainability issues might not be sufficiently captured;\n3.        May be unable to correctly signal economic unsustainability in the event that environmental marginal-damage-curves relevant to an economy are characterized by non-linearities (Hamilton and Naikal 2014b); \n4.        Is limited in its comprehensiveness in measuring change in natural capital by omitting the value of changes in environmental stocks including fisheries, groundwater, soils and biodiversity (Dietz and Neumayer 2004) due to data gaps and areas of un-agreed methodology, as well as inconsistencies in the treatment of environmental externalities (Neumayer, 2000);\n5.        The GS rule becomes more complex if the assumption of constant population is abandoned, with population growth negatively impacting sustainability once population growth is accounted for. GS therefore needs to be measured at a per-capita level for sustainable per capita welfare to be protected; \n6.        By being linked to standard accounting measures tracked at a national level, GS is not well suited to account for unsustainable pressures overseas from a population due to domestic consumption made possible through the occurrence of trade;\n7.        Its accounting of human capital savings is incomplete as depreciation of human capital is not estimated (Hamilton, 2003).\n\n\n\nDevelopments outside of the SNA\n\nIndicators replacing GDP\n\n\nExpanded Welfare Measures\n\nGenuine Progress Indicator\nThe ‘genuine progress indicator’ (GPI) attempts to track ‘genuine’ economic welfare arising through economic activity. GPI builds on Daly and Cobb’s (1992) Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW). It departs from an estimate of personal consumption adjusted for income inequality, after which further adjustments are made to attempt to distinguish utility-increasing expenditures on one hand from defensive expenditures (Daly and Cobb, 1989) and environmental damages (Vemuri and Costanza, 2006) on the other.\nMore specifically, the production of GPI involves adjusting personal consumption figures with economic indicators accounting for inequality, the timing of welfare benefits derived from durable consumer goods, the costs of unemployment and net capital investment within economic domains. Further adjustments are made to account for the costs of water, air and noise pollution, the loss of ecosystem services and the depletion of non-renewable ecosystem services within the environmental domain. For social aspects, an attempt is made to account for the value of work within the household, costs of family changes and crime, commuting and loss of leisure time as well as the value of volunteering and higher education (Lawn, 2014).\nA key insight of the ISEW and GPI identified by Max-Neef (1995) is that beyond a point, per capita GDP stops being correlated with per capita GPI, and additional welfare benefits from GDP growth are limited or negative. While comprehensive in its measurement, GPI has been critiqued on the basis of:\n1.        Not providing a rule by which to determine the sustainability of economic welfare (Neumayer, 1999; Dietz and Neumayer, 2007; Harris, 2007);\n2.        Assuming replacement costs increase over time, which is likely erroneous because, for instance, while replacement of hydrocarbons with renewable technologies e.g. solar might have been more expensive in the past, it has now got cheaper and may continue to do so through innovation; \n3.        Its treatment of the distribution of income which fails to command general agreement; and\n4.        It assuming a compounding or cumulative environmental damage function (Neumayer, 2000) as per Daly and Cobb (1989), the value of which is measured in terms of the opportunity cost of a fund contributed to by the internalized externality of emissions. This has been argued to be an incorrect approach if marginal social cost (MSC) values are used given these already internalize accumulated costs. Removing this feature has actually been shown to negate Max-Neef’s threshold effect (Neumayer, 2000). \n\n\nHuman Development Index\nThe United Nations’ Development Programme’s Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite unweighted indices combining a measure of standard of living, health and education (proxied as per capita GDP, life expectancy at birth, and years of education for an average adult and the Gross Enrollment Index, respectively). The measure normalizes each variable to a scale of between 0-1 and averages across these using the mean (initially arithmetic and then geometric) to produce an annual value for a country. The Inequality-Adjusted measure of HDI goes further by discounting each dimension’s average value according to the inequality of that value within the relevant population (UNDP, 2020). Issues identified with the measure of HDI and its variants include:\n1.        That while it can offer a broader insight into the determinants of human development, it can not necessarily give insight into its sustainability, for which it would need to incorporate a mechanism for accounting for over-exploitation of resources (Sagar and Najam, 1998); and\n2.        HDI assigns weights to certain factors that imply equal trade-offs when these measurements may not always be equally valuable. For example, countries could achieve the same HDI through different combinations of life expectancy and GNI per capita.\n\n\nJones and Klenow’s Wellbeing Index\nJones and Klenow propose an index combining data on consumption with three non-market factors—leisure, excessive inequality, and mortality— to calculate expected lifetime economic benefits for a population over time. The index focusses on consumption rather than income, adding to this the value of leisure (or home production), and subtracting costs related to inequality. These adjustments are made within a utility function (Jones and Klenow, 2016), with consumption weighted heavily within the index. This calculation measured across one year is then multiplied by the average life expectancy within a country to give a measure of average expected lifetime welfare adjusted for consumption, leisure, inequality and life-expectancy. The USA is used as a benchmark (i.e. =1) in the index, with all other countries’ values measured in relation to this. Bannister and Mourmouras (2018) have sought to extend this work to include measures of environmental externalities based on global externality costs of GHGs through assuming a tax is applied to the population proportionate to the externality of global GHGs they emit. This is done in a partial manner by accounting for solely the costs of externalities on consumption, rather than across all measures making up the index such as life expectancy or leisure.\n\n\n\nSubjective Wellbeing Measures\nA rational understanding of welfare might justifiably be argued to need to incorporate subjective perspectives (Doyal and Gough, 1991). Easterlin (1974) observed that within a country, rich people tend to be happier than poor people, but across countries, rich nations tend not to be much happier than poorer ones. Welfare and wellbeing can be understood in objective terms i.e. the circumstances of a person’s life such as income or life expectancy as well as in subjective terms i.e. the personal judgements of these circumstances people have, inclusive of their own perceived happiness and satisfaction. Happiness is a subjective evaluation of those objective circumstances, but with no universally accepted and used definition. This is reflected in the different ways happiness has sought to be measured, for instance:\n1.        Current/remembered reported emotion elicited through questions such as ‘how happy are you right now?’;\n2.        Cognitive life evaluations elicited through questions such as ‘how happy are you with your life as a whole?’;\n3.        Eudaimonic happiness elicited through questions such as ‘does your life have meaning and purpose?’\nThe link between income and subjective wellbeing is complex for reasons including that income is often a ‘positional good’, while people can adapt to increasing income levels. Subjective wellbeing measures have been expanded on within the 2018 HMT Green Book, however problems associated with the subjective wellbeing approach and basing policy on self-reported experienced utility include:\n1.        Potentially flawed assumptions of interpersonal comparability;\n2.        Measurement issues relating to the choice of scales and the influence of moods\n&lt;https://www.lse.ac.uk/PBS/assets/documents/SPCW-WELLBEING-FINAL.pdf&gt;\n\n\nBiophysical Indicators\nBroadly, biophysical indicators as presented here are those which do not incorporate monetary valuation.\n\nMaterial Flows\nModern societies require great quantities of different types of materials, some used in bulk, while others are highly specialized and are used in minute quantities (Hoekstra, 2020). Inspired by the work of Ayres and Knees (1969) on industry metabolism, studies of material flows apply the biological concept of metabolism to human society, utilizing quantitative assessment to describe or analyse these. Such studies generally depart from the view that the sheer scale of humanity’s material use creates environmental problems and needs to be reduced accordingly (Daly, 1992). ‘Resource Flow or Material Flow Analysis (MFA) can be considered as the application of the biological concept of metabolism to human society.’ (Wiedmann et al. 2006). Material flow data is collected on a regular basis across a number of countries in accordance with the Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounting (EW-MFA) framework reflected in the SEEA-CF, meaning figures produced can be consistent with the principles and system boundaries of the SNA. Materials examined in material flow accounts are broadly categorised into biomass, fossil fuels, metal ores and non-metal ores.\nIn recent years, awareness of policy makers generally increased regarding the significance not only of materials and products directly used by a national economy, or a regional economy such as the EU, but also of indirect resource use required along supply chains and embodied in internationally traded products. Therefore due to the nature of increasingly complex production supply chains, consumption-based measurement of material flows have become increasingly relevant and more widely developed, often drawing on economic data captured in the SNA as a means of reallocating material extraction. Issues with material flow accounting approaches include:\n1.        Material flow accounting (MFA) generally focusses on flows of material resources, without sufficient consideration for other types of resources e.g. water. The virtual water concept, as an example, expands the remit of inquiry to other types of resources that society uses.\n2.        From an ecological standpoint, an additive approach based purely on weight can be problematic as two forms of material throughput with different environmental profiles cannot meaningfully be compared on the basis of weight just because they can be expressed in that same unit. Environmentally-weighted material consumption (EMC) tries to account for this by using environmental impact coefficients derived from life cycle analysis to weight the unit of each material type by its environmental impacts (van der Vote et al. 2003). Others have sought to translate material extraction into measures of areal extent e.g. Maus et al. (2020).\n\n\nEcological Footprint\n“Footprint” calculations are a technique through which environmental pressures are\nattributed to domestic demand. The ecological footprint reveals the amount of land and water (surface area) that is necessary to produce a certain consumption bundle. The ecological footprint (EF) defines national sustainability in terms of an EF which is either less than nationally available biocapacity, or less than an equal share of global biocapacity when presented on a per capita basis. The vector for comparison between supply and demand is surface area (Ceballos et al. 2005). EF has enjoyed fairly widespread use, being used in UN Development Program Human Development Reports and in Welsh Government sustainability goals, while it has been applied at a range of scales from communities and cities to the globe. The metric builds on earlier measures of the impact of humans on ecosystems such as Vitsouek’s et al.’s (1986) Human Appropriation of Net Primary Production (HANPP). EF takes a consumption-based approach and is theoretically premised on a ‘strong sustainability’ interpretation by requiring that nations maintain non-declining levels of natural wealth through aligning consumption with planetary constraints (Daly 2005; Wackernagel et al. 2014). Methodologically, a nation’s EF is calculated by converting its populations’ demand for resources and functions including food, energy, and requirements for absorbing waste, into the area of land (global hectares) required to produce these sustainably given current technologies. This demand is then compared to the area of land that a nation actually has for producing those resources (i.e. its biocapacity) or if on a per capita basis, the global hectares available per person, with sustainability seen to arise if areal demand is equal to, or less than, supply. Issues identified with the EF as a measure of sustainable development include:\n1.        The focus of comparison in terms of land area has been critiqued for lacking a biophysical basis in terms of understanding of thresholds (Blomqvist et al. 2013);\n2.        It has been critiqued for lacking a socioeconomic dimension, though this might be justified given that the indicator foremostly defines economic sustainability in terms of adherence to environmental limits. To incorporate socioeconomic content, some authors e.g. Moran et al. (2008) have proposed looking at the Human Development Index and EF side-by-side, and requiring, for instance, that for a country to be sustainable that it’s EF is no greater than biocapacity and HDI no less than 0.8;\n3.        Empirically, the conversion to land area of various environmental demand has been critiqued in some instances. For instance, energy consumption has taken up half of the global EF, but this is contested e.g. due to a variable treatment of nuclear energy through time (Ayres, 2000);\n4.        EF’s aggregation of factors controlled by different policy areas can arguably provide limited signals as to where policy effort should most effectively be deployed to enhance societal sustainability, though some policy prescriptions can be teased from the indicator e.g. reducing consumption demands and increasing land efficiency; and\n5.        Methodologically, aggregation flaws arise by applying the same average biocapacity yield for resources globally, such that a nation may incorrectly be shown to be overshooting biocapacity if its yields for a given resource are greater than average (Van Kooten and Bulte 2000).\n\n\nPlanetary Boundaries\nThe ‘planetary boundaries’ (PB) concept (Rockstrom et al. 2009) precursored by Opschoor’s (1987) concept of ‘environmental space’ is an attempt to identify what a safe level of environmental use might be based on the view that at any point in time, there are limits to the degree of environmental pressure the Earth’s ecosystems can withstand without irreversible damage to these and the life supporting processes they support. The PB concept is grounded in the view that some natural capital components measured in terms of regulating services are non-substitutable. The underlying message of the metric is to remain within these boundaries so as to not overstep tipping points, though translation into management targets is required (Bringezu, 2019).\n&lt;https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/is-europe-living-within-the-planets-limits&gt;\n\n\n\nHybrid Indicators\n\nSustainability Gaps\nHueting’s (1980) ‘Sustainable National Income’ (SNI) attempts to adjust national income for the technical and structural costs of meeting strong sustainability standards as well as defensive expenditures. A prerequisite is to establish states of ecosystem which maintain vital environmental functions. The ‘Sustainability Gap’ then refers to the difference between observed states of the environment or pressures causing natural capital assets to be at that non-optimal level and that threshold level consistent with strong sustainability (Ekins and Simon 1999). The gap can be expressed in physical or monetary terms and reflects the level of reinvestment and change an economy needs to make to maintain, protect and restore ecosystems to the level required by society. Ekins and Simon in extending this work advise against calculating SNI using monetary valuation of the degree of change in the economy over time to reach sustainable levels of resource use due to significant non-marginal price changes (Dietz and Neumayer, 2007).\n\n\n‘Doughnut’ economics\nRaworth’s ‘doughnut’ (2017) has been proposed as a dashboard approach measuring national and global sustainability based on meeting human needs within the ‘planetary boundaries’ defined by Rockstrom et al. (2009). A ‘just and safe’ level of development is understood as the space between two concentric circles, the outer extent of which represents PB’s that should not be surpassed given known assimilative and regenerative capacities, uncertainty and precaution, and the inner circle of which represents satisfying human needs as codified in the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n\nGross Ecosystem Product\nGross Ecosystem Product (GEP) seeks to measure the total value of final ecosystem goods and services supplied to people in a given region annually (Ouyang et al. 2020). It brings together an assessment of biophysical production values of ecosystem goods and final services (regulating and cultural services, with supporting services implicitly valued (Boyd and Banzhaf, 2007) through physical accounting based on SEEA-EEA, with ecosystem service pricing based on market and non-market valuation to quantify, in monetary terms, the flow of services from ecosystems in a given period. Such an approach is valuable as ecosystems provide a crucial source of welfare to those marginally engaged in markets as well as to people in ways outside of the market e.g. via non-exchanged amenity values (Vedeld et al. 2004). GEP can be written as:\nWhere EPV is the economic value of ecosystem provision, ERV that of regulating services and ECV that of cultural services."

    "section": "Measuring Resource Use",
    "text": "Measuring Resource Use\nThere are a range of methodologies available for analysing material flows, the choice of which will affect final estimates. The most widely established methodological framework for measuring material resource flows at a national level is the Economy-Wide Material Flow Accounting (EW-MFA) system (Eurostat, 2018) which underpins the SNA SEEA Material Flow Accounts (SNA-SEEA-MFA). The system seeks to standardise how material inputs to the economy, net additions of materials to stocks and outflows (disposal of waste and emissions and exports) are measured by national statistics offices in accordance with the mass balance principle (conservation of mass principle).\n&lt;http://sciencesearch.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&Completed=0&ProjectID=14064&gt;\n\nIndicators\nIn a closed economy or at the global level, the sum of domestic resource extraction (DE) is equivalent to consumption-based material flow indicators such as domestic material consumption (DMC)[7] or raw material consumption (RMC) as well as their equivalent input-based indicators e.g., direct material input (DMI)[8] and Raw Material Input (RMI) as all trade flows net out.\nThe indicators total material consumption (TMC) and Total Material Requirement (TMR)[9] expands the system accounting boundary by including unused flows. Input indicators illustrate all material inputs to the domestic economy, independent of whether products are consumed domestically or exported. As a result, these are not additive across countries in the manner consumption-based figures are, which conversely exclude the materials embedded in exports from a country.\nGenerally speaking, the broader the scope of the measure, the higher the potential uncertainty in the figures. EW-MFA consumption and input indicators track the same material resource flows which are categorised at a high level into biomass, metallic and non-metallic mineral resources and fossil fuels.\n\nDomestic Material Consumption\nDomestic Material Consumption (DMC) is a headline indicator derived from the EW-MFA and SEEA-CF-MFA systems. It is currently the most widely used material flow-based indicator at the core of national statistical reporting on material flows. DMC is calculated by summing the used fraction of domestically extracted and harvested materials and the weight of imported raw materials, semi-finished and manufactured products, while excluding the weight of exported raw materials, semi-finished and manufactured products.\nDMC can therefore be written as:\nWhere DE is domestic extraction and PtB defines the physical trade balance of Im i.e. imports and Ex i.e. exports. DMC excludes hidden flows throughout. A closely linked indicator, Direct Material Input (DMI) is based on the same methodology but incorporates the materials mobilised or used in the production of exported goods and services (OECD, 2008).\nBoth DMI and DMC are weighted towards resource use activities within national boundaries and in that sense are more akin to ‘production’ oriented economic measures and similar to the manner in which UNFCCC accounting is undertaken for greenhouse gas emissions.\nKey benefits of DMC and DMI include that their underlying methodologies are well documented, with national and official statistics largely drawn on in their compilation. This makes the compilation of their figures relatively transparent. The accuracy of these measures is also thought to be relatively high. A key issue with both indicators is referred to a problem of ‘asymmetry’. That is, the weight of the traded components of material flows are based on the weight of goods crossing the border rather than the weight of raw materials used to produce those goods, contrasting with the treatment of domestic extraction. Where goods crossing the border are raw materials, this doesn’t immediately pose an issue, however where the goods crossing borders through trade are finished or semi-finished products, this means there is a risk of systematic underestimation of the quantity of raw material extraction required to satisfy demand for import-intensive countries.\n\n\nRaw Material Consumption\nTo capture the environmental implications of trade and increasingly globalised value chains, consumption-based accounting has sought to complement traditional production-based accounting (Peters and Hertwich, 2008). Like DMC, indicators of raw material consumption (RMC) seek to measure domestic used material extraction, but in addition, also the full upstream used material extraction associated with the production of imports along their supply chains. Similarly to DMC, it excludes hidden flows throughout. Raw material input (RMI) is based on the same methodology but incorporates the raw materials mobilised or used in the production of exported goods and services.\nA key benefit of using RMC over DMC is that it looks to measure both the weight of domestic extraction and overseas raw material extraction associated with the production of imports on an equal basis, rather than measuring imports based on the weight of materials and finished products crossing national borders. This is increasingly useful given the growth of complex international supply chains due to processes of specialization and cost-reduction seeking. By attempting to account for the indirect raw material ‘rucksack’ associated with imports, RMC and RMI may be subject to higher levels of uncertainty than indicators which focus on measuring materials directly used within the economy.\nWhile there is ongoing work to harmonize methodologies for measuring RMC at an international level, the United Nations (UN) SNA-SEEA 2012 ‘Applications and Extensions’ handbook states ’consumption-based indicators should be based on data and relationships contained in input-output tables; ideally…multiregional input-output tables should be used’ (page. 17)."

    "text": "Coefficient Based Method\nA method for estimating RMC developed by Eurostat works by applying ‘raw material equivalents’ (RME) to monetary import and export data using coefficients. In the context of EW-MFA, this approach was initially developed by the Wuppertal Institute in the 1990s. The approach can be written as:\nWhere RME refers to the raw material equivalents applied to each trade-related element of the formula and underlying elements are those which feed into a measure of national DMC. The material coefficients applied to the traded elements have been calculated using data from input-output tables, domestic extraction data from MFA and life-cycle-inventories. While an improvement over DMC by attempting to resolve the asymmetrical treatment between domestic extraction and traded components, the coefficient method struggles to accurately quantify materials associated with re-imported goods that cross borders several times, can have truncation errors (by not capturing the whole complexity of production chains so certain up-stream chains have to be “cut off”. introduced when the full material supply chain is not accounted for, while conversion factors can be sourced from various years making inter-temporal comparison difficult (Owen, Giesekam and Barrett, 2017). This method has been applied to estimating UK-level RMC for approaching a decade (Defra, 2011).\n\nMulti-Regional Input-Output Approach[LO6] \nNAMEA\nWiedmann et al. (2015) [4] defined the RMC as the “global allocation of used raw material extraction to the final demand of an economy . . .  which does not record the actual physical movement of materials within and among countries but, instead, enumerates the link between the beginning of a production chain (where raw materials are extracted from the natural environment) and its end (where a product or service is consumed)” (p. 6271).\nInput-output economics was founded by the Russian-American economist Wassily Leontief (1936). Input-Output Analysis (IOA) play a central role in helping industrial ecologists understand which components of socioeconomic systems contribute to the extraction, transformation, use, and discard of natural resources to produce, reproduce, and operate their biophysical structures (Wiedland et al. 2019). An Environmentally-Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output Table (EEMRIOT) table is an integrated dataset that combines two elements: a monetary input-output table (MIOT) representing monetary inter-industry flows and final demand, and an extension table in physical units depicting environmental flows associated with those economic activities (Wiedland et al. 2019). One of the key data requirements for this approach is therefore national input-output tables which underpin the production of headline economic indicators such as GDP and are collected in accordance with the SNA. Another is the material flow accounts collected by countries in accordance with SNA-SEEA-CF guidance.\nA method for calculating RMC has been developed by the University of Leeds (UoL) on behalf of Defra since 2017 and builds on a similar methodology for estimating the UK carbon footprint developed since 2008 (Barrett, Owen and Sakai, 2011). It involves reallocating domestic extraction (as calculated through the SEEA and EW-MFA accounting system) by country and world region at a 15 category disaggregation, to final demand in the UK in a given year using a MRIO database underpinned by supply and use tables (SUTs)[10] produced by the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) and input-output tables compiled within the EXIOBASE MRIO database for trade data sourced from US COMTRADE alongside separate sources for material extensions. This approach usefully covers the whole economy in a systematic way, thereby avoiding truncation errors and double counting as different supply-chains are clearly distinguished from each other in the monetary input-output tables and allows for material inputs to re-imported goods to be more accurately measured. The methodology is extremely data intensive, requiring regular information on material extraction, production structures and international trade relations of trade partners (Eisenmenger et al. 2016). Eisenmenger et al. (2016) compared calculations of Austrian RMC for the year 2007 using 7 different approaches, with 4 of these MRIO and 3 hybrid life-cycle analysis-IO approaches. Results diverged significantly, with the spread of results between 21t/cap and 33 t/cap.\n\n\nTotal Material Consumption\nTotal material consumption (TMC) and its input-based equivalent, total material requirement (TMR) are metrics which expand the system boundaries of DMC and RMC to account for both used and unused extraction within a country in addition to used and unused extraction associated with upstream production activities associated with domestic consumption. Unused extraction includes the likes of mining overburden and bycatch from fishing. This measure is the most comprehensive out of those presented and viewed as most representative of overall environmental pressure (Lutter and Giljum, 2014; Kovanda, 2020), though is also associated with greatest uncertainty. TMR was calculated for the UK as part of the ONS Environmental Accounts up to 2013 (ONS, 2013).\n\n\nComparing available resource use measures\nSome general strengths and weaknesses for each measure of resource use currently tracked on a regular basis at a UK-level are set out in the table below."

    "section": "Measuring Resource Productivity/Intensity",
    "text": "Measuring Resource Productivity/Intensity\n“Intensity indicators compare trends in economic activity such as value-added, income or consumption with trends in specific environmental flows such as emissions, energy and water use, and flows of waste. These indicators are expressed as either intensity or productivity ratios, where intensity indicators are calculated as the ratio of the environmental flow to the measure of economic activity, and productivity indicators are the inverse of this ratio.” (SEEA-Environment Extensions, 2012, pg. 13).\nBoth can be used to indicate decoupling, but conceptually different (productivity focussed on maximisation, efficiency focussed on the right level) and differ in their emphasis.\nAt its most basic, a measure of efficiency or productivity tells us about a relationship in terms of scale between an output and an input. Singular measures of resource efficiency/productivity (as opposite to combined measures e.g. total factor productivity) generally seek to track the effectiveness with which an economy or sub-national process uses resource inputs to generate material or service outputs or anthropocentric value of some description.\nAllocative efficiency is a state of the economy in which production is aligned with consumer preferences; in particular, every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers equal to the marginal cost of producing.\nResource efficiency and productivity can be defined with respect to (OECD, 2008):\n•         Physical or technical efficiency i.e. the quantity of a physical output in relation to a unit of resource input, with both expressed in physical terms (e.g. tonnes of crude steel produced in relation to a tonne of iron ore inputs). These may be desired outputs e.g. floor area or usable products or undesired outputs e.g. waste; (process level)\n•         Service efficiency i.e. the quantity of a service or function e.g. km travelled per mass unit of material resource inputs for providing that service or function (MIPS); (meso-level)\n•         Economic efficiency/productivity i.e. the money value of resources outputs relative to the money value of resource input(s) from either a cost-minimisation or benefit-maximization perspective; (process, meso and macro level)\n•         Economic-physical productivity i.e. the money value of outputs per mass unit of material resource inputs. (macro level).\n–         ‘Many authors treat both productivity and efficiency as the ratio between output and input, not indicating any difference between the two concepts (Sengupta 1995; Cooper et al. 2000). We define efficiency as the distance measure, that is, the difference between the actual ratio of inputs and outputs and the best possible combination of them. Efficiency and productivity, in any case, remain complementary concepts. Measures of efficiency are more accurate than those of productivity, as they involve a comparison with the most efficient combination, whereas productivity is based solely on the ratio of outputs to inputs (Daraio and Simar, 2007).’ (Toma, Massari and Miglietta, 2016). - At a macro-level linked to the notion of allocative efficiency.\nOther more complex multifaceted definitions: ‘’resource efficient development (…) allows the economy to create more with less, delivering greater value with less input, using resources in a sustainable way and minimising their impacts on the environment.’\nAt a national level, intensity indicators related to resource use are generally constructed by relating aggregate national economic output or value added to flow measures of resource input, both for the same time period, and are often presented as macro-economic concepts alongside labour or capital productivity (OECD, 2008). Tracking such a measure can help give insight into whether a country is decoupling economic output from resource use in a given year.\n‘Utilization of data on environmental flows. Commonly, information on environmental flows will not be strictly aligned to the measurement boundaries of the SEEA. Care should therefore be taken to record appropriately, with adjustment as necessary, entries for purchases abroad by tourists and re-exports. Careful attention should also be paid to the general issue of recording data on a residence basis rather than on a territory basis (see the SEEA Central Framework sect. 3.3, for details).’ - MFA calculated on a territorial basis I think, while GDP on a residency basis\n\nConsiderations around Indicator Structure\nFor efficiency measures related to resource use, an indicator can either be structured as a ratio with material use a denominator and value output a numerator such as with resource productivity, or alternatively structured with material use as a numerator and a measure of output as a denominator such as with resource efficiency. There are differences in emphasis and connotations between these two presentations. While productivity is frequently presented as a ratio, translating resource use into monetary terms based on foregone future values and current and future environmental damages in monetary terms, would allow for a measure of productivity derived through subtracting costs from aggregate output. Such an approach might align more closely with economic theory and weight material consumption impacts in welfare terms.\n\n\nPossible Output Indicator for an Efficiency Target\nAn output indicator component of a resource-related efficiency measure might be selected to represent:\n1.        A desired output the indicator developer perceives society should be pursuing; or\n2.        Something that is currently pursued in society and which the indicator developer wishes to see a decoupling of resource demands from.\nThere is a fundamental question in an efficiency measure regarding whether we are trying to actively steer society through both the denominator and numerator. It is also important to consider statistical coherence between the output and input measure, i.e. the degree to which they are logically connected and mutually consistent. While GDP includes final domestic demand and revenues from net exports in monetary terms, DMC includes domestic extraction and physical-net imports, reflecting that trade in materials and money, move in opposite directions (Eisenberger et al. 2016).\nThis chapter has identified some of the issues associated with GDP as a measure of economic welfare and wellbeing more generally, as well as some of the reasons it has remained so prominent as a metric guiding society over the last century. This prominence, even in the context of significant criticism of the metric may be a basis for justifying its use as an output metric within a measure of resource productivity. Using a headline measure of the SNA such as GDP which is widely recognised and pursued even if undesirable in some regards, accepts that society is pursuing this but nevertheless says, you can only continue to pursue this if you decouple it from resource use. There is a risk around whether incorporating a measure such as GDP may lead to redundancy in the metric over time if GDP becomes less of a focus over time for society. We might alternatively wish to use a measure we view as a more desirable output or outcome, but there might be some issues with this.\nThe output indicator, where relevant, can be normalised e.g. GDP placed on a per capita basis (usually taken as the standard of living), with median rather than average values used to potentially better account for distribution, or GDP adjusted based on a measure of inequality such as the Gini Coefficient and as included in the measure of HDI, though there are concerns with such an approach too e.g. Nolan (2019)."

    "text": "An Absolute vs. Efficiency Target\nSome of the pros and cons of resource-use related targets levied in absolute terms e.g. a reduction in tonnages by a given date compared to efficiency targets e.g. a reduction in the material intensity (per capita or per unit of output) is given.\n\n\n\nAbsolute\nEfficiency\n\n\n•         Gives more certainty regarding outcome\n•         Has the potential to still deliver improvements in resource productivity but while ensuring absolute decoupling\n•         Focus on decoupling of welfare from resource use.

Notwithstanding the significant uncertainty associated with such estimates, several authors have sought to define what an acceptable level of material extraction globally might be, variously accounting for the potential resource and waste-related environmental limits. Dittrich et al. (2012), for instance, suggest that global material extraction should not exceed 50 Gt y-1, about half the level evident today and equating to a global per capita limit of 8 tonnes y-1 by 2030. This level was echoed in a separate analysis by Hoekstra and Wiedmann (2014) and Mont et al. (2013) in O’Neill et al. 2018. UNEP’s International Resource Panel (IRP) recommends a per capita target of between 6 and 8 tonnes y-1 by 2050 (2014). Bringenzu (2015) based on a higher population growth projection than that used in the IRP study, suggests a per capita target value of 5 tonnes for the year 2050, with a range of 3-6 tonnes (based on returning to year 2000 material use of 50.8 Gt).\n            Bringezu (2019) – it has been suggested to limit the cropland required for final consumption of agricultural goods to 0.20 ha/person in 2030, corresponding to 0.16 ha/person in 2050 in order to halt the loss of global biodiversity by land use change.\n•         Potential for significant welfare impacts\n•         Policies that improve resource efficiency might be able to achieve decoupling, but higher resource efficiency might also boost economic growth and resource consumption as it shifts the macroeconomic production frontier and increases consumer income.\n•         Of the 27 EU Member States whose resource productivity improved between 2000 and 2017, 12 have experienced an increase in demand for materials over the same period. In some cases, the increase was substantial: Malta 71 %, Estonia 70 %, Lithuania 63 %, Bulgaria 46 %, Luxembourg 34 %, Poland 33 %, Slovakia 32 % and Sweden 31 %. In general, policies and targets for reducing overall material use are far less common than those aimed at increasing resource productivity (EEA, 2018)\n•         Rebound effects - Economic theory shows that growth occurs when an economy becomes more efficient, in the sense that production processes require fewer resources to achieve the same or greater levels of output. In the long run, these “productivity” improvements lead to increases in national income which are used for purposes such as buying products or services, or investing in natural capital. Uncertainty in the level of resource use it will deliver even if the target is met. Technological progress can and does raise resource productivity. But for larger systems under conditions of economic growth and stable (or even declining) resource prices usually rebound effects occur that (out)balance those productivity gains – thus the resource use of the larger system, despite resource productivity gains, remains the same or even rises. (Alcott 2005; Ayres et al. 2007; Binswanger 2001; Holm and Englund 2009; see: Jevon’ s paradox: Polimeni and Alcott 2008).’\n•         However increases in growth are not unbounded (can only go as high as the costs of resources)\n•         “If GDP increases at a quicker pace than resource consumption, then mechanically GDP/DMC increases. This would be considered as a progress. But European resource consumption could still increase in absolute terms (way beyond what is sustainable), which would be a failure. Therefore such an aggregated indicator would hide a negative trend for the absolute resource consumption of Europe – which is THE main sustainability issue.” (WWF, 2012)\n\n\n\nBringezu (2015) argues that material flow related targets should be based on the perspective of a future metabolic system that can operate within the global bio-geo-sphere for centuries to come, and this therefore implies the need for an understanding of the implications of material flows for the bio-geo-sphere and limits to these within understood thresholds. Beyond the general prescription that current levels of primary material use in industrialised countries is likely greater than a sustainable level, quantifying more precisely what a ‘sustainable’ level of resource use might look like has proven difficult. The environmental science around resource use is currently far weaker than that associated with the climate and it therefore remains difficult to say with any degree of certainty, what might constitute a ‘sustainable level of resource use’ (Bleischwitz, ). Complicating the matter is the fact that environmental impacts vary by material type, and thus not only overall tonnages but also the composition of material use must be considered (unlike for globally intermixing gasses such as carbon dioxide), while in addition, the environmental intensity of resource use can be moderated by technologies of extraction and production which may improve with time. Fischer-Kowalski et al. (2010) argue that ’even if estimates of capacity limits are uncertain and some degree of substitution and capacity expansion is assumed, by many measures humanity has already exceeded environmental carrying capacity.\nNew report published as part of 2 year programme on Circular Economy Taskforce entitled ‘why the UK needs a new vision for resource use’. Pushing for a halving of resource use by 2050. Argues for needing a clear vision on: 1) incentives; 2) products; 3) behaviours; 4) business models; 5) logistics; and 6) infrastructure similar to carbon management. For carbon, there is a clear vision, budgets, legally binding targets and input from the CCC.

It is a economic-based consumption-side or inflow oriented approach.\nImproved public procurement guidance and requirements in line with circular economy criteria can also play a role given the significant demand-side leverage the Government can exert as a larger purchaser.

A 2009 study by WRAP and the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) examined the potential of 14 resource efficiency strategies, including altered public sector procurement.\nA study by ERM (2011) found few policies or government initiatives in the UK had lifetime extension as their primary aim, a finding echoed in a more recent 2016 assessment of policies across the EU by Montvalo, Peck and Rietveld. ERM worked from the basis that an assessment of generics impacts of lifetime extension policies across groups of products may prove problematic and focus instead on 13 measures applied across different shortlisted products that are viewed as having greatest potential for lifetime extension. As an example, voluntary product durability standards, mandatory durability declarations and extended warranties were considered as potentially effective ways to extend the lifespans of washing machines, while Enhanced Capital Allowances (ECAs) and green public procurement were identified as suitable measures for extending the lifespan of laptops.\nAn example of effective green procurement requirements is the Energy Star programme in the USA which aimed to improve energy efficiency in over 35 product categories, with its success partly linked to them being introduced in a context of the threat of more stringent energy standards being put in place. Sweden have put in place public procurement requirements for refurbished ICT equipment in Swedish municipalities with the potential to drive demand for reused products, associated certification and also then supply of reused/refurbishment products (Crawford et al.
