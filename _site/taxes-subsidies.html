<div class="callout-body-container">
<p>In market economies such as the UK, prices parameterise activity. Prices for resources and waste management which don’t reflect associated negative externalities can therefore incentivise the over-consumption of resources and over-production of waste (Bleischwitz, 2010; Defra, 2011). Price and market-based instruments (PMBIs) seek to incentivise outcomes by directly affecting payoff structures via the price system (Stavins, 2001). This is often framed in terms of internalising ‘externalities’ i.e.&nbsp;costs to society not already captured in market prices (Pigou, 1920; Coase, 1960).</p>
<p>Several PMBIs levied on material flows have been applied across UK value chains to date, including on: the extraction of certain non-metallic minerals (Aggregates Levy); plastic packaging not meeting a 30% recycled content threshold (Packaging Tax); the consumption of single use carrier bags (SUCBs); and certain waste disposal routes (Landfill Tax). Proposed changes and additions to these include: increased rates across existing instruments; adjusted general taxation including for VAT, business rates and National Insurance contributions for activities such as maintenance and repair; altered charge structures and removal of exemptions; and taxation extended to wider materials than in scope at present.</p>
<p>We explore existing applications of PMBIs in the UK against several CSFs, examine conditions for their effectiveness - including their design, and look at pros and cons of prospective changes and wider applications of PMBIs within a UK CE framework.</p>

<h1>How it works and current applications</h1>
<p>PMBIs are used in an attempt to achieve a more optimal level of environmental use by reflecting or internalising the true environmental/social costs of production or consumption in market prices (and therefore private cost functions) or alternatively and to the same end, by creating property rights and facilitating the establishment of proxy markets in which to trade these.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Administered prices (in some cases referred to as ‘non-market-based economic and fiscal instruments’ <a href="https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/tp/10.pdf">UNFCCC, 2014</a>) involve introducing a price where one did not previously exist or modifying an existing price on goods or services to better reflect otherwise externalised social costs in market prices (Pigou, 1920) and in doing so, alter behaviour.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Sub-types include:</p>

<p>Taxes<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> relevant to the CE include those levied: on (characteristics of) materials or products within the economy; and on the use of the environment as a <em>source</em> (such as a tax on primary material extraction or transformed inputs such as energy) or <em>sink</em>, whether for solid waste (such as a tax on landfilling activities) or gaseous wastes (such as levied on greenhouse gas emissions). In addition, the tax regime covering relevant factor markets such as labour or capital can be altered such as via relief schemes to incentivise activities which indirectly impact environmental use such as a reduction in VAT charged on repair services.</p>
<p>Current applications in the UK include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Aggregates Levy</em><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> - Introduced in the UK in 2002, a tax levied on the commercial exploitation of rock, sand and gravel in the UK (<a href="https://ieep.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/UK-Aggregates-Levy-final.pdf">Ettlinger, 2022</a>). Current rates are £2.03 per tonne, with proposals for separate systems in some DAs e.g.&nbsp;the proposed Scottish <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/breaking-new-ground-developing-scottish-tax-replace-uk-aggregates-levy-consultation/">Aggregates Levy</a>;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Plastic Packaging Tax</em> - Introduced in the UK in 2022, a tax on plastic packaging with less than 30% recycled content. Current rates are £210.82 per tonne;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Landfill Tax</em> - Introduced in the UK in 1996, a two-tiered tax on the treatment of waste by landfill. Current rates are £102.10 per tonne for the ‘standard rate’ (including municipal waste) and £3.25 per tonne for the lower rate covering inert materials;</p></li>
<li><p><em>Climate Change Levy</em> - Introduced in the UK in 2001, a tax on energy delivered to non-domestic users.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Current rates are £0.00775 per kWh electricity, £0.00672 per KwH gas and £0.02175 per kg LPG.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p></li>

<p>Tax relief involves adjusting existing taxes to reduce disincentives to particular behaviours. Applications in the UK include the:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Enhanced Capital Allowances for water and energy-saving technologies</em> - A form of tax relief, currently used in the UK to incentivise the use of water-saving and energy-saving technologies in the past</li>
</ul>
<p>Subsidies are a payments to an actor either to not undertake environmental bads or to subsidize the provision of environmental goods. These can take the form of lump sums e.g.&nbsp;for capital costs or per unit subsidies for desired results. Subsidies differ from grants which are generally issued for specific purposes. Applications in the UK include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Boiler Scrappage Scheme</em> - Introduced in 2010, the scheme aimed to encourage the replacement of old boilers with newer more energy efficient ones</p></li>
<li><p><em>Feed-in tariff scheme for renewable energy sources</em> - Introduced by Department of Energy and Climate Change and Ofgem from 2010 to stimulate the uptake of renewable energy sources in order to combat climate change and improve energy security.</p></li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-fit">Strategic fit</h2>
<p>Tax and charge-based approaches generally have low levels of strategic fit among households. The results of the third OECD Survey on Environmental Policies and Individual Behaviour Change (EPIC) published in the 2023 OECD report ‘How Green is Household Behaviour’ (<a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/2bbbb663-en/1/3/1/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/2bbbb663-en&amp;_csp_=3837f5bbbb774a9988d38f9b7b30111f&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=book#section-d1e316-43ad546dea">OECD, 2023</a>) found tax and charge-based approaches were the least supported policy measure by household respondents across domains including food and transport. The tax burden in the UK is project to rise to 37.1% of GDP by 2027-28 (OBR, 2022). While this lack of support may be primarily in relation to their costs, there is also the issue of fairness with price-based instruments being viewed as allowing wealthier actors to buy their way out of responsibility or buying a license to pollute. There is a more nuanced picture across instruments, however. Almost half of respondents to a 2020 YouGov survey supported an increase in the charge on plastic bag from 5p to 10p, which was then subsquently implemened (<a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2020/09/02/18d46/1">YouGov, 2020</a>).</p>
<p>For business, taxes may be opposed as these can cost more to regultees than prescriptive regulatory approaches. Markets are generally more politically desirable than taxes - less fear government will abuse the system for revenue generation ends, the polluter pays only for the non-optimal portion of total emissions (though not always) and can feel more in control of a permit system (Pearce and Barbier, 2000).</p>
<p>Reductions in the current tax regime such as on VAT, capital allowances and too subsidies are also least preferred options by government authorities due to reductions in tax receipts and exchequer costs.</p>
<p>Taxation of carbon embodied in traded products is more advanced that embodied materials (as captured by measures of raw material consumption), and has the potential to deliver reductions in resource use, material substitution and an increase in secondary material use, though depends on how taxes are responded to.</p>
<p>Ackerman and Stewart (1988) provide support for the permit trading system arguing for its synonymity with other values of fairness, yet at a time when there was limited experience with how these markets worked, and biased by the successes of the SOx market in California.</p>
<p>Winter (2010) - moral accordance. Argues that the emission target rather redefines the maximum ceiling as an exploitable right. He argues that the ‘cap and trade’ concept has turned a genuinely ecological problem into an economic problem, leading us to lose sight of the ecological purpose of the overall enterprise. Winter suggests that in light of the failures of emissions trading given their lack of achievement and high administration burden, substantial and quick progress is better achieved by fostering new technologies and inducing behavioural change as well as a pragmatic mix of emission and technology standards, subsidies, taxes, voluntary agreements and polycentric governance.</p>
<p>Baldwin (2008) - Whilst recognising the political feasibility of Trading Systems due to it being in the language of trade and appearing non-threatening to firms, credible questions have arisen regarding the efficiency, fairness and transparency of ET. ETS offer no advantage other than that economic. Baldwin argues that contrary to Ackerman and Stewart’s (1988) claim of trading offering democratically accountable approaches to reducing emissions, market based systems have an inherent bias in favour of parties who possess wealth and whilst cost effective do not ensure fairness (OECD, 2002).</p>

<p>Environemntal effectiveness includes immediacy, scale of impact, predictability/certainty of impact. The effectiveness of PMBIs depends on their ability to alter the economics of production, purchasing and use choices. This, in turn, depends on the level at which they are set and the elasticity of demand for regulated goods/services including abatement costs across regulated subjects influenced also by the relative price of substitutes.</p>

<p>In theory, increasing the price of primary resources can be expected to reduce the environmental pressures associated with their consumption. This can occur through: 1) reducing the use of resource inputs into production and consumption processes; and 2) driving input substitution away from primary materials towards those secondary (Government Office for Science, 2014).</p>
<p>The UK Aggregates Levy introduced in 2002 had the dual aim of reducing the negative environmental impacts of quarrying and increasing the recycling rate of construction materials by making the costs of virgin material inputs more costly (<a href="https://ieep.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/UK-Aggregates-Levy-final.pdf">Ettlinger, 2022</a>).<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> Between 2002 and 2018, total aggregation consumption has fallen while the share of aggregates from secondary sources increased (MPA, 2019) - implying also an absolute decoupling of construction industry output from primary material input. However, these impacts are difficult to attribute to the levy alone (<a href="https://ieep.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/UK-Aggregates-Levy-final.pdf">Ettlinger 2022</a>), with secondary aggregate consumption on an upward trend prior to the introduction of the Levy, and potentially also linked to the Landfill Tax (introduced in 1996) which encouraged the creation of secondary markets.</p>
<p>A 2011 meta-study of virgin material taxation schemes found these reduced the domestic supply of virgin materials when in place, but often only led to limited increase in the use of recycled materials as virgin materials could be sourced overseas (Söderholm, 2011).</p>

<p>Data published by Wrap showed 12.2 billion single-use carrier bags (SUCB) were used by customers across UK supermarkets in 2006. Wales introduced a 5p charge per SUCB in 2011, followed by N. Ireland in 2013, Scotland in 2014 and in 2015 in England through the statutory instrument Single Use Carrier Bags Charges (England) Order 2015 No.&nbsp;776. At the time of introduction, the charge in England was expected to save GBP60m savings in litter clean-up costs and GBP13m in carbon savings (<a href="https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/plastic-bag-charge-in-the-uk">Centre for Public Impact, 2016</a>).</p>
<p>The charge on single use carrier bags in England - initially introduced at 5p and since 2021 increased to 10p while being extended to all shops, has seen a significant decrease in the number of single use bags issued by retailers of approximately 80% (Defra, 2022).</p>

<p>The Landfill Tax was introduced in the United Kingdom in 1996 and applied to all waste disposed of at a licensed landfill site in an attempt to better reflect environmental costs of landfilling in its price, and in doing so, reduce waste entering landfill and associated environmental impact. The tax has since been devolved to Scotland and Wales (<a href="https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/tax-by-tax-spend-by-spend/devolved-landfill-taxes/">OBR, 2023</a>).</p>
<p>A review shortly after the introduction of the tax found it had led to a modest reduction in waste to landfill from industry, but not by households (Morris, Phillips and Read, 1998) and that quantities of waste landfilled remained relatively stable between 1996 and 2003 (<a href="https://ieep.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/UK-Landfill-Tax-final.pdf">Elliot,</a> 2016). With annual rate increases, LACW sent to landfill in England fell by an estimated 90% between 2000 and 2021, while total waste landfill (including non-household waste), has also fallen albeit at a slower pace.</p>
<p>A 2021 study by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34051583/">Panzone <em>et al.</em></a>using a ridge-regression approach, found the tax has been effective in shifting waste generated to alternative end-destinations than landfill - although to a large extent, this has been incineration.</p>

<p>Due to the simultaneous effects of other policy instruments, it is difficult to attribute this reduction to the Landfill Tax. A <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34051583/">2023 review</a> of the Landfill Disposal Tax (LDT) in Wales found that increases in recycling since devolution of the tax to Wales in 2017 via the Landfill Disposals Tax (Wales) Act 2017, couldn’t be attributed to the LDT and that other factors including recycling targets had a greater effect on increasing recycling and reuse, while other factors such as zero waste to landfill requirements have been more impactful in driving uptake of alternative technologies.</p>

<p>A key issue with price-based instrument is that without precise information about the aggregate marginal abatement cost curve or the price elasticity of those subject to a tax, the aggregate environmental outcome of a given tax rate can be difficult to predict and necessitate a trial-and-error approach which can delay environmental improvements (Pearce and Barbier, 2000).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="charge-rebate">Charge-rebate</h3>
<p>The Vehicle component core charge is an example of a charge-rebate scheme in place in the UK to encourage old vehicle parts to be returned for remanufacturing or sound disposal once replaced. It can be levied at a rate of choice by retailer of the spare part and applies to alternators, brake calipers, car batteries, semi-axles, injectors, high pressure fuel pumps, compressors, starters, and several other vehicle components.</p>
<p>Deposit-Return Schemes for drinks containers have been planned across the UK for some time, with Scotland due to launch a DRS in 2025 following several delays (from an original launch date in 2022) and DRS schemes planned for introduction in Wales, England and N. Ireland also in 2025. Anticipated benefits of these schemes include increasing capture rates, encouraging safe disposal and improving the quality of recycling materials. DRS have been applied elsewhere and driven the following effects…</p>

<section id="subsidies" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="subsidies">Subsidies</h3>
<p>The effectiveness of subsidies in delivering environmental change depends on their design. Subsidies can encourage potential beneficiaries to register with the government, increasing participation rates and can also deliver change relatively quickly by acting as a demand-pull mechanism e.g.&nbsp;for new technologies.</p>
<p>Using the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model, Bibas, Chateau and Lanszi (2021) assessed the global economic and environmental impacts of fiscal reform consisting of taxes on primary metal and mineral resources and the circulation of revenues to finance subsidies to recycled goods and secondary metal production. They found this would deliver a relative decoupling of primary material use from economic growth to 2040, with a reduction of 7% in metallic and non-metallic minerals compared to the baseline scenario alongside negligible effect on global GDP (loss of 0.2% global GDP in 2040).</p>
<p>The overall effectiveness of subsidies to not perform environmental bads can be undermined by the incentive they give for new firms to enter markets to receive these subsidies, meaning that while per-firm impact may go down, total impact across the economy may go up. An example of this was Australia’s emissions fund established in 2018. These forms of subsidy are ideal only where other instruments do not work or are too expensive.</p>
<p>VAT relief on the sale of used items was identified as a likely low-impact measure for reducing large and small WEEE by Resource Future (2012).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>
<p>A key proposed benefit of PMBIs is that they can help achieve a particular level of environmental use at the lowest overall cost to society (i.e.&nbsp;are most statically efficient) while providing ongoing incentives to bring down abatement costs over time (Pearce, 2002; Johnson, 1999). This is largely said to be enabled through their flexibility, which allows polluters with lower marginal abatement costs to undertake (more) abatement than those with higher MACs (for whom, paying the tax may be more cost effective) in line with the equimarginal principle (Goulder and Parry 2008).</p>

<p>The assumed efficiency benefits of PMBIs are attributed to the rationale that if a price is introduced or adjusted to account for environmental impacts, market participants can be incentivised to reduce their environmental use until the cost of abating a further unit of use equals the marginal benefit of reducing that use in terms of avoided tax payments. Across the sector or the economy regulated, this would translate to environmental users with the least abatement costs reducing use more than those facing steeper abatement costs, thereby helping a given level of use be achieved at least cost in line with the equimarginal principle which assumes that societal welfare is maximised when the net present value of marginal abatement benefits equal that of marginal abatement costs (Baumol &amp; Oates, 1971). These cost reductions have been shown in a variety of cases e.g.&nbsp;SO2 trading scheme under the USA Clean Air Act (Goulder, 2013).</p>
<p>In addition, it is said that if tax revenue accrued by instruments are used by the government to offset distortionary taxes such as those on labour thereby contributing to change in relative factor prices, it can help further improve market efficiency (Vence and Pérez, 2021). The Ex’tax Project argues that “High taxes on labour encourage businesses to minimise their number of employees. Resources, however, tend to be untaxed; they are used unrestrained. This system causes unemployment, overconsumption and pollution”.</p>
<p>The aggregate costs to society (including industry, LAs and the public) of abatement, compliance and administration (<a href="https://dynamix-project.eu/sites/default/files/Aggregates_UK.pdf">Bicket and Salmons, 2013</a>). There has been the following effect on the mining and quarrying sector in the UK, with the following effects on competitiveness… The quarrying of aggregates such as sand, gravel and crushed rock remains the most common type of mineral operation in England ().</p>
<p>Charge-rebate schemes are cited as having potentially high transaction costs.</p>
<p>Where regulation is so stringent all available abatement measures must be taken, market-based instruments aren’t always significantly more cost-effective than standards.</p>
<p>The EU has put into practice the trading theory through the ETS through the Emissions Trading Directive, adopted in 2003 and amended in 2009, which applies to large installations throughout Europe and seeks to reduce their GHG emissions by 40% compared to the baseline by 2030. The EU ETS has been seen as a resounding failure due to several issues: 1) Technical - Overall cap being too generous resulting in the price of permits being too low and leaving little incentive for further reduction through the sale of permits 2) Principled - with issues of fairness related to the permit dissemination approach of grandfathering being questioned and 3) Foundation - with the commodification of environmental quality.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="affordability">Affordability</h2>
<p>The UK government raises over £820 billion a year in receipts, primarily through The income tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) and value added tax (VAT) which together raise over £470 billion. Environmental taxes make up a relatively small share of this revenue, though nevertheless appear to generate net-revenues for government.</p>

<p>In theory, PMBIs can generate administrative savings in time and money by devolving management decisions from regulators to private decision makers who are better aware of their own abatement costs (Baumol and Oates, 1971; Stavins, 1998).</p>
<p>Revenue generating instruments preferred from an affordability perspective than subsidies. Where subsidies are offered, these need to be financed. For example, a €154 million fund announced in 2023 and set up to cover payments to citizens in France, who will be able to claim €7 for mending a heel and €10-€25 for clothing repairs between 2023-2028. Subsidies present a cost to the government which if funded through general taxation can also be economically distortive.</p>
<p>‘The latest HMRC statistics show that the aggregate levy raised £407m in total receipts in the 2016/17 financial year (a proportion of this has funded the Aggregate Levy Sustainability Fund managed by Natural England). This has been the largest amount collected.’ Resource-related taxation makes up a relatively small share of total environmental taxes in the UK (ONS, 2023).</p>

<p>Transaction costs (including search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs and policing and enforcing costs) can be prohibitive to the establishment/functioning of many of these instruments. Knowledge of both the aggregate MAC and the aggregate MDC is needed for taxes to be set at an efficient level of environmental use, which can present high costs (Cole and Grossman, 2002; Ogus, 2004). Assumed benefits of optimal pricing scenarios in rational choice and welfare maximising frameworks imply likely high information requirements for both the MDC and MAC, which leads regulators to general seek acceptable or improved rather than optimal levels (Pearca and Turner, 1990). Can require administrative infrastructure for measurement and monitoring which may not be present or may be prohibitively costly for certain forms of pricing, which may require the use of a proxy.</p>
<p>Can be difficult to determine the right amount of permits to allocate - under allocate and the economy might be harmed, over allocate and emission levels won’t be reached. Difficult to get the price right for taxes. Knowledge of both the aggregate MAC and the aggregate MDC is needed for taxes to achieve the efficient level of pollution. Though less informationally taxing than C&amp;C which requires knowledge of each firm’s MAC, this information can still elude a regulation.</p>
<p>Taxes are more commonly used in governments than administered markets. C&amp;T system can involve greater regulatory burden because there are costs of setting up a market for auctioning and trading allowances and the regulator must not only keep track of emissions of facilities, but also establish a registry to record changes in ownership of allowances as a result of purchases or sales.</p>
<p>A potential advantage of permits with grandfathering-based allocations is the increase of incentives for pollution sources to identify themselves in order to claim their permits.</p>
<p>Taxes increase costs of products and activities in a predictable manner, making it easier to judge first round financial impact on consumers and firms (OECD 2011) in comparison to permits, for which the future price can be difficult to predict. Can be difficult to determine the right number of permits to allocate as an underallocation may lead to high costs, and an overallocation can limit the ability to reach a desired level of environmental use. Regulators can use best estimates but carries environmental (e.g.&nbsp;irreversible damage) and economic (e.g.&nbsp;locking firms into technological choices) risks (Hanley et al.&nbsp;1997).</p>
<p>On the flip side, some of these instruments (taxes, charges and auctioned permits) can generate tax revenues which can offset administrative costs, be ringfenced to finance further improvements in a target industry and potentially more distortionary taxes if used for this purpose. Revenue recycliing can play an important role in defining the overall efficiency of PMBIs, including via reducing the cost-ramp of alternative technologies. When people do not trust that a carbon price will be sufficient to reduce emissions, they prefer using the carbon price revenue to subsidise low-carbon technologies and research. The state doesn’t collect as much revenue with markets as taxes, though you can auction permits, and do so annually to increase revenues. Administered markets are generally more resource-consuming than non-market fiscal instruments, and both require monitoring.</p>
<p>By using tradable emissions systems, the statutory variable becomes the pollution level rather than technology allowing greater focus and intelligent priority setting at the administrative level through reducing the requirement of knowing technological information and reducing the fear of controlling further pollutants because of the admin burden it would bring. Ackerman and Stewart (1988)</p>

<p>In theory and where relevant, PMBIs provide continuous incentives for further environmental harm reduction through innovation, commercialization and adoption of technologies which lower aggregate costs, because doing so saves tax expenditures. General economic instruments have been shown to have encouraged diffusion and incremental-type-innovation in the automotive and energy sectors (Bergek and Berggren, 2014).</p>
<p>Administered markets can be superior in this effect because of the incentive to sell permits and not only reduce tax liability. For instance, Calel and Dechezlepretre (2016) found that the EU ETS increased low-carbon innovation by as much as 10% among ‘pollution-light’ firms. At the same time, a lack of immediacy possible due to complications in the mechanism can lead to stalling R&amp;D in industries with high MACs (and in the long-run a less immediate transition to lower-pollution heavy production).</p>
<p>The effectiveness of taxes are contingent on the prices of the taxed good or service (if traded) not going down which would otherwise lessen the effectiveness of prices in signaling change. Long-term cost effectiveness of price vs quantity mechanisms are affected by their responsiveness to change. This can vary in three circumstances: 1) In the presence of rapid rates of economic growth, a fixed tax leads to an increase of aggregate emissions whereas permits can give no allowance to this, but the price of permits increases to account for the enhanced desire for them; 2) In the context of inflation, a unit tax decreases in real terms and so emissions levels increases, whereas with a permit system there is no change in the aggregate; and 3) In the presence of exogenous technological change, a tax system leads to increases in control levels and a decrease in aggregate emissions whilst a permit system maintains emissions with a fall in permit prices.</p>

<p>Though addressing the environmental externality, prices alone may not address the innovation market failures comprehensively as may pull through sub-optimal technologies, thereby necessitating supply-side technology instruments being introduced alongside (Goulder, 2013).</p>
<p>Baldwin suggests that innovation from the ETS is less than believed, arguing that well designed C&amp;C methods can do so in a better manner (Fischer, 2005). The reason it inhibits innovation is that trading allows high-cost abatement to not arise because low-cost abatement permits can be purchased, resulting in the curve of falling abatement costs not being embarked on, thereby postponing cost reductions and technological betterment (Driesen,2003). Uncertainty in prices has further inhibited immediate action as firms in Europe have waited for price to go down before purchasing required permits. The sale of Sao Paulo’s emission reductions from MSW methane capture as a credit to the West slowed action taken by the West.</p>

<p>Taxes can be regressive i.e.&nbsp;lower income groups may pay higher share of overall income to service them, though depending on revenue recycling models. Callan et al.&nbsp;(2009) found a carbon tax of 20 euros/tCO2 with revenue recycling in Ireland was marginally regressive, though if the tax revenue were used to increase social benefits and tax credits, households across the income distribution would be made better off without exhausting the total carbon tax. Grainger and Kolstad (2009) a Co2 tax would be 4x higher for the lower quintile of US population than upper quintile. However, design is also important. They found this wouldn’t necessarily be the case for a tax such as on gasoline which would be progressive.</p>

<p>PMBIs can also create hotspots of concentrated pollution which can disproportionately affect subpopulations, leading to spatially engendered inequity.</p>
<p>Regressive effects may not be solely restricted to households. Introducing a raw material tax might disproportionately affect those sectors that are not able to easily substitute raw materials for secondary materials. Using the OECD’s ENV-Linkages model, Bibas, Chateau and Lanszi (2021) assessed the global economic and environmental impacts of fiscal reform consisting of taxes on primary metal and mineral resources and the circulation of revenues to finance subsidies to recycled goods and secondary metal production. They found this would deliver a relative decoupling of primary material use from economic growth to 2040, with a reduction of 7% in metallic and non-metallic minerals compared to the baseline scenario alongside negligible effect on global GDP (loss of 0.2% global GDP in 2040). Regional disparities were identified, depends on whether countries were net importers or exporters of raw materials, available production technologies and input costs of primary and secondary materials.</p>
<p>Chateau and Mavroeidi (2020) in the study ‘The jobs potential of a transition towards a resource efficient and circular economy’, examined the consequences of a policy-driven transition towards a more resource-efficient and circular economy on employment levels across countries and sectors between 2018-40 using the structural computable general equilibrium model ENV-Linkages. The reallocation of jobs due to a package of fiscal policies was found to be limited, with net job creation globally positive but marginally, at 1.8 million, with high variability between industries and countries. Countries with large extraction sectors were found to see net-job losses, as was the case in sectors depending heavily on primary materials such as construction and some manufacturing sectors, including production of machinery and electronic equipment. Secondary metals and recyclable sectors benefited from large increases in employment. In a scenario in which only OECD countries implemented these policies, employment losses were expected relative to the baseline due to a relative loss of competitiveness.</p>
<p>f the permit allocation method is through grandfathering, polluting firms are rewarded for their emissions, with the costs of reduction tending to be disproportionately burdened on the poor especially in the case of grandfathering (Parry et al.&nbsp;2005). This allocation method has arisen due to intense lobbying in the EU ETS by powerful interest groups.</p>

<p>Spillovers can occur across various materials, regions, and activities. For example, in the UK, the shift towards using “bags for life” highlights this phenomenon. A study by the Environment Agency revealed that these bags must be used at least four times to make them less impactful on climate change compared to single-use plastic bags (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-62350235">BBC, 2022</a>). Similarly, the Aggregates Levy has had cross-border effects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland due to the lack of a tax on aggregates or primary materials in Ireland (EEA, 2008), although this was somewhat mitigated by the levy credit scheme (ACLS). A 2021 report by the National Audit Office found that the Landfill Tax might have led to an increase in fly-tipping rates. In Wales, the 2016 post-implementation review of the single-use carrier bag charge found that only 13% of eligible firms reported a negative impact on their business. A study of deposit-return systems in 12 cases found no correlation between the introduction of the charge-refund scheme and sales while simultaneously driving an improvement in the quality of recyclate (<a href="https://packagingeurope.com/news/do-deposit-return-schemes-negatively-affect-beverage-sales/10097.article">Packaging Europe, 2023</a>). The OECD (2022) has explored interactions between deposit-return systems and other extended producer responsibility (EPR) mechanisms, noting some potentially negative interactions highlighted by the industry (Packaging Portal, 2023). The MPA has also advocated for the reinstatement of the Aggregates Levy Community Fund (<a href="https://www.aggbusiness.com/ab10/news/mpa-calls-reinstatement-aggregates-levy-community-fund">AggBusiness, 2021</a>).</p>

<p>A 2023 OECD review recommend exploring an “increase in aggregates tax to encourage further resource efficiency and recycling in construction.” However “The UK’s recover rate of construction and demolition waste was at 89.9% in 2014 so it is not certain whether a further increase in the aggregate levy might result in additional use of recycled aggregate. If there are no alternatives to the virgin products used in construction such as concrete, the rise in the levy would increase the construction project costs.”</p>
<p>Possible changes to the higher-rate landfill tax</p>
<p>In addition, existing tax regimes covering relevant factor markets such as labour or capital can be altered such as via relief schemes to incentivise activities which indirectly impact environmental use such as a reduction in VAT charged on repair services.</p>
<p>De Camillis and Goralczyk (2013) discuss several methodologies capable of determining variable VAT rates depending on the environmental product performance based on LCA indicators. They simulate a case study that shows considerable potential to deliver significant impacts on unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Another proposal calls for a reform of the current VAT system by introducing differentiations between sectors, products and services, and product and service groups, which are identified as particularly resource and carbon intensive and sets out how a harmonisation of the overall system and an ecological differentiation in single consumption areas could contribute to support the transition to a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy (Bahn-Walkowiak and Wilts 2015).</p>

<p>A 2023 OECD review recommend “considering…the introduction of incineration taxes to provide further incentives for recycling and avoid a”lock-in” of incineration capacity”.</p>
<p>Based on the experience of the aggregate levy and other countries, the UK could introduce a virgin material taxes across a selected number of raw materials. “For example, following Latvia’s example of the Natural Resource Tax (since 1991, extended in 2014), the tax mandate could be extended to any commercial activity connected with extraction of natural resources, environmental pollution, goods and products that are harmful to the environment, packaging and disposable tableware. The rationale and size of each levy would need to be determined by the associated environmental impacts.” Practical complexities of introducing material taxation beyond primary material inputs.</p>
<p>The potential negative impact of the tax on economic growth would need to be considered. While a number of academic studies assessing the impact of material tax indicate a potential long-term increase in GDP this is often conditioned on increased support to R&amp;D activities through the collected tax revenues.</p>

<p>For TEPs, effective monitoring must be in place for the policy to work (Goulder, 2013) e.g.&nbsp;difficulty of setting up TEP aimed at water pollution in USA and elsewhere (Borghesi, 2013), and issues of compliance undermining effectiveness of cap &amp; trade under Kyoto. Work best when covering pollutants that can be monitored easily e.g.&nbsp;point source pollutants.</p>
<p>Different MBIs are suited to different uses e.g.&nbsp;biodiversity are more skewed towards subsidy models while pollution-reduction are more skewed towards taxes. Trading schemes may be more relevant for some environmental issues than others.</p>
<p>Taxes and tradable permits most suitable where there is little variability in damage per unit of pollution. Taxes preferred of the two where there is high e.g.&nbsp;geographical variability in MDCs as these can be adjusted for different areas.</p>
<p>Rights-based instruments can be applied to directly control aggregate quantities of harmful activities and outputs, according them much greater appeal in situations where the dependability of environmental outcomes is paramount (e.g.&nbsp;in the management of toxic waste). In the absence of information about the aggregate marginal abatement cost function of agents, price-based instruments cannot deliver precise aggregate outcomes in first rounds of governance. Use quantity-based approaches when the MDC is steep because the optimal level of a pollution is very low and also when steeper than the MAC curve - while C&amp;C as an outright ban may be cheaper here.</p>
<p>The textbook vision of efficient emission trading assumes that emissions can be standardized into a homogeneous commodity that can be accurately metered for each regulated emitter and a under the control of the polluter, and that the spatial location of emissions within the market doesn’t affect the environmental outcome. These assumptions often won’t hold for water pollution control contexts (Shortle, 2013).</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="market-conditions">Market Conditions</h3>
<p>Where there are many polluters, taxation is superior to cap-and-trade (Pizer 1997). Where there are a lesser number of regulated sources - mainly producers, and with highly variable MACs between them, cap-and-trade is preferable, though sufficient sources are needed for a market to be established.</p>
<p>PMBIs are most effective for products whose demand or output is sensitive to price change.</p>
<p>Efficient when the cost of abating pollution differs widely among sources, giving greater potential gains that C&amp;C regulation.</p>
<p>Permits better for certainty in the presence of rapid rates of economic growth, as a fixed tax leads to an increase in aggregate emissions whereas permits do not allow this, with prices just rising to account for this.</p>
<p>Permits better for certainty in a context of price inflation, a unit tax decreases in real terms so emissions levels will increase whereas for permits, there is no change in the aggregate.</p>
<p>Taxes better for long-term improvements in the presence of exogenous technological change, a tax system leads to increases in control levels and a decrease in aggregate emissions while a permit system maintains emissions, with a fall in permit prices.</p>
<p>If uncertainty about MAC is significant and if the MAC is flat, then a quantity instrument will be more efficient than a price instrument (Weitzman, 1974).</p>
<p>Markets have many pre-requisites for benefits to materialize (Cole &amp; Grossman, 1999):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Monitoring and enforcement needs to be sound (Aakre and Hovi 2010, D’Amato and Valentini 2011, Brandt and Svendsen 2014). Monitoring MBIs may be more difficult, and if ineffective, price of emissions may be inefficiently low and not encourage the sought level of emissions. Monitoring prices likely to reduce with time though.</p></li>
<li><p>Requires competitive market: in order to fully exploit efficiency gains, however the permit market may not be perfectly competitive because of a small number of polluters or bigger firms manipulating prices. Price volatility may have negative consequences e.g.&nbsp;rendering investment decisions difficult as firms don’t know if reductions will definitely pay off.</p></li>
<li><p>Assumes market participants have knowledge of their own MACs etc. and capabilities to engage in efficiency-enhancing trades.</p></li>
<li><p>Relies on an absence of corruption: Over-allocation of permits can be an issue, leading to low prices and low incentives. There is a higher susceptibility of fraud e.g.&nbsp;the PRN system in the UK.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="governmental-conditions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="governmental-conditions">Governmental Conditions</h3>
<p>When incomplete enforcement occurs in the presence of uncertainty, quantity instruments perform relatively better than equivalent price instruments.</p>
<p>Though addressing the environmental externality, these do not address the innovation market failures comprehensively, where supply-side technology instruments are needed.</p>
<p>To ensure administered markets work effectively and efficiently, government has to guarantee that permits can be traded freely and will not be over-allocated alongside sound monitoring and enforcement (Cole &amp; Grossman, 1999), while to maintain dynamic efficiency, their numbers must be reduced over time.</p>
<p>For dynamic efficiency, prices must be high enough and expected to remain in place given costs and uncertain returns of technological efforts.</p>
<p>Price volatility may also have negative consequences e.g.&nbsp;rendering investment decisions difficult as firms don’t know if reductions will definitely pay off. Volatility can be managed through price ceilings or floors and inter-temporal banking.</p>
<p>For Static Efficiency: An initial carbon tax should be modest because it imposes a deadweight loss as it penalizes decisions made before there was a carbon tax (Wigley, Richels, and Edmonds 1996). Over time, the carbon tax should rise. Net present abatement costs are lowest if all emissions from all sectors and all countries are taxed equally and if the carbon tax rises at a modified Hotelling rate (Hotelling 1931, Van Der Ploeg and Withagen, 2014).</p>
<p>Charge-rebate systems - Most effective if applied to products with an existing distribution system and where reuse and recycling is technically and economically feasible.</p>
</section>
<section id="design-and-implementation-considerations" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-and-implementation-considerations">Design and implementation considerations</h3>
<p>Public resistance to taxes can be overcome by, for instance: earmarking proceeds for other desirable uses; compensating losers using lump-sum transfers; reducing impact to possible losers by using differentiated taxes or other social cushioning measures; using environmental taxes to cut other undesirable taxes; and improving communication and information sharing to make the public feel part of the process (Carattini, Carvalho and Fankhauser, 2018).</p>
<p>Well-designed MBIs can exploit multiple abatement channels, including: a) switching to cleaner inputs; b) making use of process-integrated or end of pipe technologies; and 3) reducing the overall scale of consumption/production (Goulder and Parry 2007). The closer to the source of pollution, the better - allows more routes for abatement to be used.</p>
<p>Before PMBIs are introduced, any fiscal privileges to damaging environmental uses should be removed as these can undermine policy effectiveness and lead to counterproductive transfers (Scott, 1997).</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of tradable permits can be undermined by using a grandfathering permit allocation method versus auctioning as distortionary taxes can’t then be offset (Parry and Williams, 2010).</p>
<p>The environmental effectiveness and cost effectiveness of cap &amp; trade can be compromised by interactions with other regulations. For instance in the UK, the tax brought in on emissions in addition to the EU ETS may lead to reductions in emissions in the UK, but by making the price of EU ETS permits even lower, can lead to expansion of emissions in Europe (Goulder, 2013).</p>
<p>For charge-rebate: should be implemented alongside demand-pull mechanisms for in-scope materials e.g.&nbsp;a mnimum recycled content requirement. Most effective if applied where a distribution system exists and recyclng/reuse is economically feasible.</p>
